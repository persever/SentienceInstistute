For example, a graphic designer might think one company logo idea looks better than another, but not be able to describe exactly why. If this designer has decades of experience seeing logos succeed and fail, we should probably take their intuition seriously. Speculation is similarly challenging, but I&rsquo;m using it to refer more to logical reasoning than a single, untraceable judgment. For example, we can speculate that we should focus on animal wellbeing over consumer health when promoting animal-free foods because having a wider moral circle seems beneficial for the long-term wellbeing of sentient beings. There&rsquo;s a chain of reasoning here, but it&rsquo;s not really based on specific, empirical evidence. Anecdotes, while distinct from intuition and speculation, have many similarities as evidence so these are all considered together.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>External findings are often from RCTs, but also general findings in psychology, sociology, or other relevant fields field, such as the </span><span class="c6"><a class="c10" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identifiable_victim_effect&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1577201931912000">identifiable victim effect</a></span><span class="c2">.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><a id="t.03c5f18f83180c85b64a2bdbc06e78219671b1c5"></a><a id="t.3"></a><table class="c47"><tbody><tr class="c32"><td class="c35" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c11 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p></td><td class="c36" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c11"><span class="c2"># of outcomes</span></p></td><td class="c44" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c11"><span class="c2">Context focus</span></p></td><td class="c37" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c11"><span class="c2">Variable isolation</span></p></td><td class="c12" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c11"><span class="c2">Sample size</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c32"><td class="c35" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c11"><span class="c2">EAA RCTs</span></p></td><td class="c36" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c11"><span class="c2">3</span></p></td><td class="c44" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c11"><span class="c2">1</span></p></td><td class="c37" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c11"><span class="c2">1</span></p></td><td class="c12" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c11"><span class="c2">2</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c32"><td class="c35" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c11"><span class="c2">External findings</span></p></td><td class="c36" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c11"><span class="c2">2</span></p></td><td class="c44" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c11"><span class="c2">3</span></p></td><td class="c37" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c11"><span class="c2">2</span></p></td><td class="c12" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c11"><span class="c2">1</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c32"><td class="c35" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c11"><span class="c2">Intuition/speculation/anecdotes</span></p></td><td class="c36" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c11"><span class="c2">1</span></p></td><td class="c44" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c11"><span class="c2">2</span></p></td><td class="c37" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c11"><span class="c2">3</span></p></td><td class="c12" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c11"><span class="c2">3</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c32"><td class="c35" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c11"><span class="c2">Social Movements</span></p></td><td class="c36" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c11"><span class="c2">1</span></p></td><td class="c44" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c11"><span class="c2">3</span></p></td><td class="c37" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c11"><span class="c2">3</span></p></td><td class="c12" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c11"><span class="c2">4</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c38">1 = most desirable</span></p><h4 class="c13" id="h.7jmk39b0rptf"><span class="c15 c22">Accounting for the most outcomes, e.g. short-term and long-term effects, direct and indirect effects</span></h4><ol class="c20 lst-kix_uo80vd63frlv-0 start" start="1"><li class="c1 c5"><span>Social movements, intuition/speculation/anecdotes</span></li><li class="c1 c5"><span class="c2">External findings</span></li><li class="c1 c5"><span class="c2">EAA RCTs</span></li></ol><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Explanation: If we look back on a social movement, such as the </span><span class="c6"><a class="c10" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children%2527s_rights_movement&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1577201931918000">children&rsquo;s rights movement</a></span><span class="c2">&nbsp;of the 1800s, we can take a broad, comprehensive look at outcomes that the movement might have affected, such as the laws governing children&rsquo;s working conditions in the 1900s.

The only included meta-analysis with behavioral outcomes found statistically insignificant very small differences in favor of interventions that were not culturally competent from two studies with &ldquo;bona fide comparison groups that received the same type of treatment and dosage&rdquo; but that lacked &ldquo;additional content that was culturally sensitive&rdquo; (g = &minus;0.08, 95% CI &minus;0.51 to 0.35). Additionally, a Cochrane review noted some seemingly quite high costs for culturally competent interventions compared to the conventional diabetes education. Given that culturally competent intervention design or delivery will increase the costs of an intervention, these modifications may not be cost-effective in the short term in the farmed animal movement.

In comparison, Catholic preaching and local organizing suggest that the early anti-abortion movement had more of a focus on mass influence, though many early advocates were also professionals. The extent to which this difference made abortion reform more likely or more successful is uncertain. Nevertheless, given that abortion was decriminalized up to the point of twelve weeks of pregnancy by Roe v. Wade and that this reform, as well as public opinion on the matter, have not substantially changed since then, this provides weak evidence that social change is more likely to be successful if it is advocated for by professionals first. Additionally, the campaign for abortion reform in Hawaii in 1967-70 culminated in victory for the abortion rights movement; the abortion rights advocates seem to have been more focused on elite influencers than on the public, in contrast to the anti-abortion movement there. These findings provide only very weak evidence for the claim that advocacy for specific issues, such as for particular changes to the manner in which food production is regulated in a country, will be more likely to succeed if professionals advocate for the change first.

Taken together, this research suggests that though social movement or legislative backlash may sometimes occur and may be substantial, this only infrequently results in direct reversals of Supreme Court rulings. The reviewed literature also provides evidence that unanimous Supreme Court rulings and higher pre-decision public opinion decrease the likelihood or size of backlash, but that the number of amicus briefs submitted during a case and higher public awareness of the decision itself have the opposite effect. There is some historical evidence that just as a Supreme Court ruling that supports a social movement&rsquo;s goals may encourage mobilization by the movement&rsquo;s opponents, a Supreme Court ruling that challenges a movement&rsquo;s goals may galvanize the movement into action.

There is now an increased acceptance of the importance of various contingent factors such as the success or failure of the assassination of Franz Ferdinand and the negotiations in July 1914. Although I have not read the primary evidence myself and so do not hold confident views, it seems plausible that changes in these contingent factors would have prevented war. Historians seem to accept the importance of a variety of causes of the French Revolution. From my understanding of the evidence, it seems that while the occurrence of some sort of radical social change in France in the 18th and 19th centuries wasn&rsquo;t as dependent on contingency as the outbreak of World War I, the precise path and outcomes of the Revolution were. From an effective altruism perspective, the precise path might not be very important, but it is possible that this could have dramatically altered the outcomes of the Revolution. It seems unlikely that the development of the industrial revolution depended much on contingency given the long-term forces at play, although other forms of trajectory change may still have been tractable. In several of the included historical case studies, notably with the rise of US environmentalism in the 1960s, the apparent influence of certain intellectuals suggests that their ideas might be more important than luck or subsequent decision-making processes in shaping broad developments.&rdquo; - Jamie Harris, </span><span class="c0"><a class="c10" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/blog/how-tractable-is-changing-the-course-of-history&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1577201932043000">How tractable is changing the course of history?</a></span></p></div><div><p class="c8"><a href="#ftnt_ref224" id="ftnt224">[224]</a><span class="c15 c7">&nbsp;&ldquo;For all except one intervention type considered in this report, where evidence was available, meta-analyses suggest that effect sizes are smaller when measured at longer follow-up.

Empirical studies by social movement sociologists show that social movements and individual organizations have succeeded in having an impact but that this is difficult and usually only achieved with the support of public opinion and/or allies in the political system. Comparative historical sociologists note the importance of broad contextual factors in shaping historical outcomes, but accepting their arguments doesn&rsquo;t limit tractability much&hellip; Through researching and writing this post, I have updated towards contingency playing a greater role in determining historical outcomes than I initially hypothesized, most notably as a result of the historical case studies considered here.

For example, I attended a &quot;training&quot; run by Animal Think Tank. We were discussing the pros and cons of mass protest, and I raised the concern that mass protest, even if it raises salience, may decrease overall support, and the latter was obviously the more important goal. Someone disagreed with me because her intuition was that it is easier to change attitudes than to raise salience. I.e., once people are talking about the issue, it is easy to implement solutions. I&#39;d guess that most people would disagree with this, but it hadn&#39;t really occurred to me previously that many people might have this belief.</span></p></div><div class="c3"><p class="c11"><a href="#cmnt_ref20" id="cmnt20">[t]</a><span class="c2">If you&#39;re happy with this rewording, I can write a revised version of this section up.</span></p><p class="c11 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c2">One downside of doing this is that there would be substantial overlap with the &quot;influencer vs. mass outreach&quot; section.

E.g. Haven from Fish Welfare Initiative uses the language of moral circle expansion a lot and told me that his motivation for working on welfare reforms was because he thinks they lead to momentum for further change. But I think that the evidence for that claim is actually pretty weak, as opposed to the evidence that they just don&#39;t increase complacency.</span></p></div><div class="c3"><p class="c11"><a href="#cmnt_ref51" id="cmnt51">[ay]</a><span class="c2">Hm, I&#39;m not convinced. All of these bullet points seem to be evidence for momentum. Of course, evidence for momentum (X) will tend to also be evidence for, &quot;if welfare reforms do lead to complacency, such effects are probably quite small&quot; (if -X, effects are probably quite small).</span></p><p class="c11 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c2">I don&#39;t think the case is strong for working on welfare reforms over the alternatives (e.g. research, meta, even animal-free food tech) if one&#39;s goal is MCE, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s inconsistent or anything. I think there&#39;s certainly some evidence for it.</span></p><p class="c11 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c2">FWIW my probability distribution for various momentum/complacency effect sizes is weighted closely towards the center, i.e. if there are effects in either direction, they are probably quite small. And I think probability distributions are the best way to think about this type of question if you want to take the time and really fully understand it.</span></p><p class="c11 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c2">I think the important difference between this question and the reducetarian/vegan question is not about the state of evidence available, but the strategic options available to advocates. For r/v there is a clear midpoint option that one can implement in advocacy, but the midpoint for momentum-complacency is just uncertainty/neutrality, which is a feature of all FQs. That being said, if there were compelling evidence that specifically should pull one&#39;s probability distribution to the center (e.g. a high sample size survey with a null result), it could be worth making a special category for readability. But I don&#39;t think the current evidence meets that cutoff of compellingness.</span></p></div><div class="c3"><p class="c11"><a href="#cmnt_ref52" id="cmnt52">[az]</a><span class="c2">This more clearly matches up to my understanding from Kelly&#39;s report.</span></p><p class="c11 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c2">I suppose that the current phrasing is consistent with the definition of &quot;momentum&quot; used in FQS: &quot;does this make further progress... more or less likely?&quot;</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c2">But this does not match up to my own intuitive understanding of the phrase momentum. In physics, &quot;momentum&quot; incorporates both mass and velocity... BAS provides evidence of increased &quot;mass&quot; (i.e. tractability) but decreased &quot;velocity&quot; (i.e. support and active efforts to make further change)?</span></p><p class="c11 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c2">Btw, I&#39;d still guess that it was a good strategic decision (hence, &quot;momentum&quot; overall, by definition used in FQS) and that animal advocates should seek out equivalents</span></p></div><div class="c3"><p class="c11"><a href="#cmnt_ref53" id="cmnt53">[ba]</a><span class="c2">I see the distinction you&#39;re making, but I think the &#39;slave trade ban -&gt; slavery ban&#39; evidence is evidence for both increased tractability and active efforts after an initial reform.</span></p><p class="c11 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c2">Perhaps the argument is that the active effort was already decided (i.e. activists already planned to campaign for a slavery ban), &nbsp;and thus the active effort following the initial reform was not actually evidence of increased active effort following the initial reform?</span></p><p class="c11 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c2">I think that makes sense, and it just depends on whether momentum is defined as an increase relative to no-previous-knowledge-of-intent or relative to previous-knowledge-of-intent. Since intent is so common, I would err towards the latter. But that&#39;s quite subjective.</span></p></div><div class="c3"><p class="c11"><a href="#cmnt_ref54" id="cmnt54">[bb]</a><span class="c2">And anti-death penalty, though evidence on that is more ambiguous.</span></p></div><div class="c3"><p class="c11"><a href="#cmnt_ref55" id="cmnt55">[bc]</a><span class="c2">I didn&#39;t specifically look this up in the health behavior lit review (I was looking for evidence that some interventions were more or less effective than others more than the variations within those interventions that improved their effectiveness), so this is just the summary of previous research from 1 identified review. </span></p><p class="c11 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c2">This research is treated as fairly uncontroversial -- it forms the S in the &ldquo;S.T.A.R.T.&rdquo; criteria for evaluating goal setting used in the review.
