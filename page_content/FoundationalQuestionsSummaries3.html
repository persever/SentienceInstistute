Antispeciesism is limited somewhat in tractability by its abstract nature. For people to accept that we should help wild animals, they need some concern for those animals as well as a willingness to take action against harms that happen in nature, which is difficult for many people to accept.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt128" id="ftnt_ref128">[128]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;One counter-consideration is that people regularly participate in farmed animal cruelty by eating animal products, while they don&rsquo;t participate in wild animal suffering, at least in a similarly direct way.

Wild animal advocacy is usually individual-centric, but people often assume helping wild animals involves pursuing goals other than directly utilitarian ones, such as the preservation of a species.

A possible counterargument here is that left-wingers might be particularly defensive about the inclusion of animals in their discussions because they want to avoid diluting their focus on oppressed humans or because they have developed their identities more around human rights than around general nondiscrimination.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt131" id="ftnt_ref131">[131]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;Some EAA researchers think that counterargument is quite compelling.</span></p><h2 class="c21" id="h.ofv2osgk3gjt"><span class="c10 c17">[meta] Long-term vs. short-term focus</span></h2><p class="c15"><span class="c1">Explanation: Should we give more weight to long-term outcomes or short-term outcomes?

If this designer has decades of experience seeing logos succeed and fail, we should probably take their intuition seriously. Speculation is similarly challenging, but I&rsquo;m using it to refer more to logical reasoning than a single, untraceable judgment. For example, we can speculate that we should focus on animal wellbeing over consumer health when promoting animal-free foods because having a wider moral circle seems beneficial for the long-term wellbeing of sentient beings. There&rsquo;s a chain of reasoning here, but it&rsquo;s not really based on specific, empirical evidence.

It does appear, however, that the economic harm to the West Indian sugar trade was not sustained and the boycott at its peaks only ever reached around 4-6% of the population and reduced sugar sales by &#8531; to &frac12;. Its primary participants were probably usually not spending time on it that they could have put into political advocacy instead, as they were not able to participate in politics. The boycott may simply have been among the best actions women at the time were able to take.The nature of this seemingly successful consumer campaign seems to be quite different from the modern anti-animal-farming advocacy focus on individual consumer change. The sugar boycott didn&rsquo;t displace much if any political activism; it was brief; it was specific to the top West Indian export, sugar, rather than to all Slave-made goods; it was seen as a tool in advocates&rsquo; diverse toolbelt, not as the central goal of the movement; and it was able to do significant economic damage to the target industry, cutting off up to &frac12; of sugar sales at one point because it was a luxury good with concentrated consumption among the wealthy.<br><br>A better comparison for anti-animal-farming advocates&rsquo; approach to consumer action is the American &ldquo;free produce&rdquo; movement and the abstinence from Slave-made goods among some Quakers and a rare few other individuals. Though the failure of Quaker abstinence may have had more to do with their limited influence in society than with the strategy itself, American advocates&rsquo; efforts to convince consumers to abstain from purchasing the products of the target industry were considered relatively ineffective by the advocates themselves after two decades of limited success.&rdquo; - Kelly Witwicki, </span><span class="c0"><a class="c9" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/british-antislavery%23consumer-action&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1529604508576000">Social Movement Lessons From the British Antislavery Movement</a></span><span class="c0">, section </span><span class="c0"><a class="c9" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/british-antislavery%23consumer-action&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1529604508577000">&ldquo;Consumer Action&rdquo;</a></span></p></div><div><p class="c2"><a href="#ftnt_ref62" id="ftnt62">[62]</a><span class="c0">&nbsp;The Humane Society of the United States, </span><span class="c4 c0"><a class="c9" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.humanesociety.org/assets/pdfs/legislation/ballot_initiatives_chart.pdf&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1529604508571000">Initiative and Referendum History - Animal Protection Issues</a></span><span class="c10 c0">, accessed November 12, 2017.</span></p></div><div><p class="c2"><a href="#ftnt_ref63" id="ftnt63">[63]</a><span class="c0">&nbsp;&ldquo;49% of US adults support a ban on factory farming, 47% support a ban on slaughterhouses, and 33% support a ban on animal farming.&rdquo; - Jacy Reese, </span><span class="c4 c0"><a class="c9" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/animal-farming-attitudes-survey-2017&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1529604508571000">Survey of US Attitudes Towards Animal Farming and Animal-Free Food October 2017</a></span></p></div><div><p class="c2"><a href="#ftnt_ref64" id="ftnt64">[64]</a><span class="c0">&nbsp;&ldquo;Much of the successful activist action against GM food came in the form of relatively small campaigns focused directly on companies (especially those occupying vulnerable positions in a supply chain).

It seems advocacy could make a crucial difference in whether they will occur, so a major portion of the expected impact of funding programs that achieve these outcomes comes from the possibility that the change would never happen otherwise. For example, it seems unclear whether society will replace animal agriculture with cultured meat, given the technology develops, and that additional funding could substantially increase the likelihood this replacement occurs. In this way, social change affects the direction of the future.<br><br>Technological change that is physically possible, on the other hand, seems likely to eventually occur even without our intervention. It seems that humans in modern society work towards technological progress for a variety of reasons like helping others, personal curiosity, and commercial profit. This, combined with the fact that backwards technological progress seems quite uncommon, unlike backwards social progress, suggests that when we fund technological progress, the primary mechanism of impact is speeding up new technologies rather than causing them to exist when they otherwise never would. In this way, technological change affects the speed of the future.&rdquo; - Jacy Reese, </span><span class="c4 c0"><a class="c9" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://animalcharityevaluators.org/blog/foundational-questions-in-effective-animal-advocacy/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1529604508556000">Foundational Questions in Animal Advocacy</a></span></p></div><div><p class="c2"><a href="#ftnt_ref112" id="ftnt112">[112]</a><span class="c0">&nbsp;&ldquo;Judging on the basis of the above two examples, the challenges involved in dramatically reducing the cost of animal-free media, and our holistic assessment of the challenges involved in reducing the cost of cultured meat, discussion with scientists who have experience with cell cultures and tissue engineering, we currently see developing cost-competitive cultured meat products as extremely challenging, and we have been unable to find any concrete paths forward that seem likely to achieve that goal.&rdquo; - Open Philanthropy Project, </span><span class="c4 c0"><a class="c9" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/cause-reports/animal-product-alternatives%23How_long_will_it_be_before_it_is_possible_to_make_cultured_meat_cost-_and_taste-competitive_with_conventional_meat&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1529604508557000">Animal Product Alternatives</a></span></p></div><div><p class="c2"><a href="#ftnt_ref113" id="ftnt113">[113]</a><span class="c0">&nbsp;&ldquo;Approximate estimate of the probability that there will be at least one cost-competitive cultured alternative for more than half of the main broad types of animal products within this animal product category in:<br><br>Animal product category&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5 years time&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10 years time&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20 years time<br>Acellular&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15%&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;40%&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;75%<br>Ground Meat&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.5%&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20%&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;55%<br>Whole Pieces of Muscle Tissue&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1%&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5%&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;30%&rdquo; - Animal Charity Evaluators, </span><span class="c4 c0"><a class="c9" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://animalcharityevaluators.org/research/dietary-impacts/cost-competitive-timeline/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1529604508557000">When Will There be Cost-Competitive Cultured Animal Products?</a></span></p></div><div><p class="c2"><a href="#ftnt_ref114" id="ftnt114">[114]</a><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c34">&ldquo;The time-lag correlations show that&mdash;taking the entire period from 1975 to 1986&mdash;the coverage by Stern (0.66), Der Spiegel (0.71) and Frankfurter Rundschau (0.47) anticipated the views of the population by three, two or one years respectively.&rdquo; - Hans Mathias Kepplinger, </span><span class="c0 c34"><a class="c9" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Hans_Kepplinger/publication/271136983_Individual_and_institutional_impacts_upon_press_coverage_of_sciences_the_case_of_nuclear_power_and_genetic_engineering_in_Germany/links/54beb0c20cf28ad7e71909a3/Individual-and-institutional-impacts-upon-press-coverage-of-sciences-the-case-of-nuclear-power-and-genetic-engineering-in-Germany.pdf&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1529604508573000">Individual and institutional impacts upon press coverage of sciences: the case of nuclear power and genetic engineering in Germany</a></span></p></div><div><p class="c2"><a href="#ftnt_ref115" id="ftnt115">[115]</a><span class="c0">&nbsp;&ldquo;In 2010, when the Sierra Club launched its Beyond Coal campaign, the US had 523 coal power plants.
