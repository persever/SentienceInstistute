Others can be, &ldquo;Join our protest calling for Walmart to improve their treatment of chickens,&rdquo; &ldquo;Sign this petition asking McDonald&rsquo;s to replace their chicken nuggets with plant-based alternatives,&rdquo; &ldquo;Vote for this ballot initiative to ban factory farming,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Visit this URL to find an animal rights organization in your city that hosts local meet-ups.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c16"><span>Second, we&rsquo;d like to see substantially less focus on advocacy </span><span class="c6">tactics</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;that work by convincing individuals one-by-one to change their consumption. The main examples here are online ads and diet-focused leaflets, though a notable exception is that leafleting is often used successfully to empower grassroots communities, such as by getting vegans involved in activism for the first time. Of course, those leaflets could still emphasize more institution-focused messages like calls to support a current political or corporate campaign.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c16"><span>We&rsquo;d like to see most of the resources currently going into these tactics instead go to tactics that focus on changing institutions: governments, companies, nonprofits, and society as a whole. For example, these resources could be spent on campaigning for companies to produce more plant-based options, on campaigning for laws to improve and enforce farmed animal welfare standards </span><span>or to ban factory farming</span><span class="c0">, or on media such as documentaries, books, articles, and nonfiction that seeks to spark conversation in society about the issues of animal farming. Media outreach likely has some effect on individuals&rsquo; diets, but we&rsquo;re prioritizing them based on their ability to facilitate discussions and create &ldquo;common knowledge&rdquo; that is useful for future advocacy. For example, undercover investigations have become common knowledge in the sense that a vegan can explain their diet choice by saying, &ldquo;I saw a lot of those investigation videos of meat production,&rdquo; and in the US, most people will understand what they&rsquo;re referencing.</span></p><h2 class="c10" id="h.akvi8ebejas"><span>Evidence</span></h2><ul class="c1 lst-kix_l0zp3l3bhr25-0 start"><li class="c9"><span class="c6">There is much more public support for institutional change than willingness to change individual habits. </span><span>Around 2% of US adults rigorously follow a vegetarian diet and less than 10% self-identify as vegetarian.

One common argument is that price, taste, and convenience are what really matter to consumers, so if we can just beat conventional animal products in those dimensions, we&rsquo;ll succeed in ending animal farming. We think that this </span><span>goes too far</span><span>&nbsp;when advocates </span><span>(which includes not just nonprofit staff, but also journalists, businesspeople, and everyone else supporting animal-free foods) focus heavily on price, taste, and convenience. A</span><span>dvocates should continue to emphasize the moral benefits, particularly animal welfare, of animal-free food technology.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c16"><span>More specifically, we think ethics</span><span>&nbsp;should be the primary message in most contexts, ahead of price, taste, and convenience. For example, in an op-ed or letter to the editor that advocates for clean meat, the ethical benefits should usually be most prominent, ahead of </span><span>personal and </span><span>commercial benefits. (There is an exception here for industry publications, such as an article in </span><span class="c17">Feedstuffs</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;that&rsquo;s aimed exclusively at people in animal agriculture and related industries.)</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c0">Note that most of the farmed animal movement is already focused on moral messaging, so this change isn&rsquo;t as big as the first two. It would mainly apply to animal-free food companies and corporate-focused nonprofits who currently focus less than non-corporate-focused nonprofits on the moral argument. We&rsquo;re still including this suggested change because maintaining a moral focus in the development of animal-free foods seems very important for ensuring the long-term success of the farmed animal movement.</span></p><h2 class="c10" id="h.4dko6xhuxvjk"><span class="c12">Evidence</span></h2><ul class="c1 lst-kix_ncp8z5w1ud0a-0 start"><li class="c9"><span class="c6">This seems to do more to create a world where factory-farming-like practices are less likely.</span><span>&nbsp;There&rsquo;s an important need for animal advocates to end the harms of animal farming as quickly as possible, but we also need to keep in mind the capacity of future generations of humans to </span><span class="c8"><a class="c5" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://foundational-research.org/reducing-risks-of-astronomical-suffering-a-neglected-priority/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1529856703156000">cause suffering on an even larger scale</a></span><span>. The biggest impact of ending animal farming might not be through helping farmed animals, but through building a world in which astronomical suffering is less likely. Because of this, ensuring the end of animal farming is as morally-driven as possible seems very important. In general, social movements have good reason to focus on the values they most strongly believe in, even if other values sometimes seem more instrumentally useful. In addition to long-term effects, this also makes it more </span><span>likely</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;that incremental changes are positive, such as reducing the number of situations where consumers decrease red meat consumption but eat more chickens and fish.</span></li></ul><p class="c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><ul class="c1 lst-kix_ncp8z5w1ud0a-0"><li class="c9"><span class="c6">The moral focus is more powerful for social change and for overcoming personal concerns like worrying that animal-free food technology is unnatural.</span><span>&nbsp;Health, price, taste, and the convenience of food are all important for individual purchasing decisions, perhaps even more than ethics, though it depends on how you measure each of these factors. However, </span><span>if our strategy for achieving widespread clean meat adoption is institutional instead of individual &mdash; which as we&rsquo;ve argued, it should be &mdash; then foregrounding the ethical motivation to end factory farming and animal slaughter is likely to be a much more powerful tool, as people seem much more easily motivated by ethics to work towards building a social movement and creating institutional change</span><span>.</span><span><br><br>Even on the individual level, this is</span><span>&nbsp;an important distinction when it comes to overcoming concerns that new animal-free food technology is unnatural or otherwise unappealing. The factors of price, taste, and convenience </span><span>are largely seen as</span><span>&nbsp;trivial </span><span>concerns</span><span>, such that </span><span>people are frequently willing to sacrifice them based on personal preference</span><span>. </span><span>For example, i</span><span>f you see a food as gross, </span><span>you&rsquo;ll probably be willing to</span><span>&nbsp;go with a different, more expensive</span><span>, </span><span>perhaps even </span><span>less tasty</span><span>&nbsp;(i.e. scores worse in blind taste tests for a general audience)</span><span>&nbsp;food. Ethics is different. If society determines a certain </span><span>product</span><span>&nbsp;is unethical, this can trump all trivial concerns in a way that the other factors can&rsquo;t. If society recognized animal farming as unethical</span><span>&nbsp;or</span><span>&nbsp;as a moral catastrophe, then it would be unacceptable to purchase conventional animal products simply because the alternative seems unnatural</span><span>, gross,</span><span>&nbsp;or otherwise unappealing. </span><span>For example, Hummers developed this </span><span class="c8"><a class="c5" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.autotrader.com/car-news/hummer-h2-most-embarrassing-car-you-can-buy-262363&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1529856703157000">ethical stigma</a></span><span>&nbsp;in the US in the 2000s, and owning one </span><span>for reasons of personal preference </span><span>could not be justified </span><span>in</span><span>&nbsp;many US social circles.</span><span>&nbsp;We see similar stigmatized products for animal, environmental, and human rights concerns, such as palm oil, chocolate, and coffee beans without fair trade certifications &mdash; though these have been stigmatized in relatively small segments of the general population.</span></li></ul><p class="c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><ul class="c1 lst-kix_ncp8z5w1ud0a-0"><li class="c9"><span class="c6">If we avoid a moral focus, we enter a dangerous territory where animal-free food technology might be seen as profit-driven.</span><span>&nbsp;Regardless of your opinion on GMOs, it&rsquo;s true that many people dislike them </span><span class="c8"><a class="c5" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://globalecoguy.org/zombie-gmo-myths-a59123a403f2&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1529856703158000">simply because</a></span><span>&nbsp;the</span><span>y see the</span><span>&nbsp;main driver of GMO technology as large, opaque corporations wanting to increase profits</span><span>, regardless of impacts on consumers and on the planet</span><span>.
