Aggregation is a particularly subjective and intuitive research challenge, and the survey was necessarily limited because the community is small, somewhat informal, and lacks agreed-upon standards for deciding whom to survey. There is also the challenge of interdependence of peer opinion in a small research community (i.e. people often base or update their views on each other&rsquo;s, rather than each fully and independently evaluating the evidence). We might conduct a more detailed survey that attempts to overcome some of these challenges in the future (e.g. ask people for their independent views, or to evaluate each piece of evidence individually), but we&rsquo;re not sure whether this would be worth these researcher&rsquo;s time.</span></p><h3 class="c3" id="h.3h81oeszwgk3"><span class="c9">Survey of US Attitudes Towards Animal Farming and Animal-Free Food October 2017</span></h3><p class="c5"><span class="c1"><a class="c7 external-link" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/animal-farming-attitudes-survey-2017&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1512584819122000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFyv6pVCxGdjU0tpzgEkUam0Si_lQ">View&nbsp;<i class="material-icons">open_in_new</i></a></span></p><p class="c5 c6"></a></span><span class="c0"> In October we asked a census-balanced sample of US adults whether they agree with statements like &ldquo;I support a ban on animal farming&rdquo; and &ldquo;Most farmed animals are treated well&hellip;&rdquo; We primarily conducted this survey to provide baseline data for tracking movement progress by repeating the survey in the future, since there&rsquo;s no other regular survey of this nature.</span></p><p class="c5 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">We were pleasantly surprised to see that respondents were even more opposed to the animal farming industry than we expected, with for instance 47% supporting a slaughterhouse ban. We already had more optimistic predictions for responses than the average animal advocate (based on informal discussions we had prior to publicizing the results) because these questions were about institutional change and for some time we&rsquo;ve thought the movement will get much more support if advocates frame animal farming as an institutional, rather than individual, problem. We think the average animal advocate hasn&rsquo;t been fully aware of how much more support institutional change can receive. Even so, the strong opposition we saw in this survey made our views even stronger in this direction, and we think it&rsquo;s evidence that advocates should favor more institutional messages (e.g. calling for legislative change instead of consumer change) and somewhat stronger messages (e.g. calling for the end of animal farming or at least the end of factory farming instead of a reduction in factory farming) than they are currently using, though of course individual and weaker messages have their roles in the movement.</span></p><p class="c5 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span>The survey was covered by </span><span class="c1"><a class="c7" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://plantbasednews.org/post/poll-shows-47-of-americans-agree-with-ban-on-slaughterhouses&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1512584819123000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEjhJ7SakeBT4gIDy3AN1fGpmmy6w">Plant Based News</a></span><span>, </span><span class="c1"><a class="c7" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://vegnews.com/articles/page.do?pageId%3D10407%26catId%3D1&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1512584819124000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEF-kdE_uL9uIBrq660OvFcZxmfqA">VegNews</a></span><span>, </span><span class="c1"><a class="c7" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.onegreenplanet.org/news/americans-want-to-ban-slaughterhouses/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1512584819124000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHWw1C146ZPD-PN8sEkPnweBB5oEQ">One Green Planet</a></span><span>, and </span><span class="c1"><a class="c7" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.organicauthority.com/70-of-americans-want-better-treatment-for-farm-animals-poll-finds/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1512584819124000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHwKgO2OGZKmVRUJZCkgIH5xX67lQ">Organic Authority</a></span><span>, and in numerous social media discussions as well as on the </span><span class="c1"><a class="c7" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.mercyforanimals.org/new-poll-47-percent-of-americans-want-to&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1512584819125000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFXqIGa0UA1rtMW40dWdEPk62vpOQ">MFA</a></span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span class="c1"><a class="c7" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.gfi.org/americans-want-to-ban-slaughter-but-love&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1512584819125000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHXRCxZ6W73GagbJ3I7dIF75MJqCA">GFI</a></span><span class="c0">&nbsp;blogs.

Existing studies on clean meat adoption have mostly focused on consumer choices, but the choices by governments, industries, and news media are similarly, or perhaps even more, important.</p><p>The evidence in this report mainly suggests that some already-promising advocacy strategies are even more effective than previously thought. Namely, supply constraints (e.g. an unreliable supplier, cumbersome regulations) on a product opposed by advocates (e.g. fossil fuel electricity, animal-based meat) can be highly effective for encouraging the rise of a competitive, advocate-favored product (e.g. nuclear energy, animal-free meat); technical explanations arguing that safety risks of a new product are minimal (e.g. that the risk of a nuclear reactor explosion is small) can easily backfire, perhaps because they legitimize the safety concerns; centralization of technological development can be very useful for public-interest-driven emerging technologies; and public opinion of an emerging technology often locks in as highly negative or highly positive based on media portrayals and salient talking points.</span></p><p class="c5 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">We worry somewhat that these sorts of confirmatory results are less valuable than surprising results that change our minds.
