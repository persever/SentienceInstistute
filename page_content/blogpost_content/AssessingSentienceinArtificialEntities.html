For example, the studies described in the previous section propose neuroanatomical features, such as the absence or presence of nociceptive cells or certain brain structures, and physiological features, such as the production of and response to analgesics. Clearly, these features are not appropriate in the case of artificial entities. Instead, we should focus on analogous features at the functional and algorithmic levels. For example, rather than the presence of physical nociceptors, we should consider the ability to detect harmful stimuli. This shift to focusing on functional and algorithmic rather than biological features requires us to assume that these higher levels are appropriate levels of analysis for understanding sentience, and that sentience can be realized in multiple substrates, not just biological ones.</span><sup class="c6 c7"><a href="#ftnt6" id="ftnt_ref6">[6]</a></sup><span class="c6">&nbsp;It may also be important to take into account the physical structure of artificial entities, which is important on some theories of consciousness.</span><sup class="c6 c7"><a href="#ftnt7" id="ftnt_ref7">[7]</a></sup></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">Another common strategy to assess sentience in nonhuman animals is to refer to its evolved function.

That is not to say we endorse either of these theories, or any other specific theory referred to in the table of features. Nor do we think that we need evidence that an entity needs to satisfy all (or even most) of the criteria in the table to be considered sentient. Rather, we think that an entity that satisfies more of the criteria more strongly warrants the attribution of sentience than an entity that satisfies fewer. In the next section we outline a method for making judgments about sentience based on the features in Table 1.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">The features we propose capture two general categories. First are features more related to valenced states, such as the detection of harmful stimuli. Second are features related to an entity&rsquo;s general capacity for experience, such as centralized information processing.</span><sup class="c6 c7"><a href="#ftnt11" id="ftnt_ref11">[11]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;Some features, such as attention directed on the source of harmful stimuli, capture both an entity&rsquo;s capacity for experience and to be in a valenced state, and therefore fall under both categories.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Note that the features listed in Table 1 are not exhaustive, precise, or distinct. We have considered several of the most prominent theories relevant to sentience, but there are many theories that we have not considered. We have also focused at this point on negatively valenced states, but we note that positively valenced states may also be relevant. More research is needed to refine and potentially expand on this list.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6 c19">Table 1: </span><span class="c0">Incomplete list of features indicative of sentience in artificial entities</span></p><a id="t.0491587adddd874486e7d8c14003899015d49bab"></a><a id="t.0"></a><table class="c27"><tbody><tr class="c14"><td class="c18" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c1"><span class="c21 c23">Feature</span></p><p class="c1 c15"><span class="c21 c23"></span></p></td><td class="c12" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c1"><span class="c21 c23">Reason for inclusion</span></p></td><td class="c5" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c1"><span class="c21 c23">Category: Valence, Experience, Both</span></p></td><td class="c5" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c1"><span class="c21 c23">Example sources referring to feature</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c14"><td class="c18" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Reinforcement learning</span></p></td><td class="c12" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Reinforcement learning refers to learning via trial and error with one&rsquo;s environment and reward signals to achieve goals.
