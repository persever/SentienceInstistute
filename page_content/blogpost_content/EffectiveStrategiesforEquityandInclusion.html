Some people have more barriers in the way of their success than others, some of which others have set in place and some of which we ourselves do, and equity is about removing those barriers to even the playing field.

It&rsquo;s important that we create a community that is sustainable and healthy, and it seems to me that we will better achieve that through restorative justice than retributive justice.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c15"><span>&ldquo;No tolerance&rdquo; is an important policy for preventing and responding to misconduct, in the sense that every issue will be addressed. But no tolerance doesn&rsquo;t require a &ldquo;heavy handed&rdquo; approach &mdash; to the contrary, I think it&rsquo;s critical for the heaviness of our responses to be commensurate with the severity of an action and to escalate progressively with failures to participate in restorative processes. Small transgressions, for instance, should be &ldquo;called in&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt17" id="ftnt_ref17">[17]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;so the person who made the apparent mistake has the opportunity to defend themselves if necessary, or to rectify their mistake and improve. If someone has committed a transgression, we want them to seek understanding, and if they do come to understand, apologize, and demonstrate a credible intention to improve, they should be given the chance to carry forward as a better community member, if possible depending on the severity of their action. To create a culture in which they are incentivized to cooperate like that, any negative consequences resulting from their admission of guilt and cooperation in restoration have to be much less severe and much less likely than the consequences of refusing to cooperate. Otherwise people will have incentive to instead aggressively defend themselves against accusations, which is a lost opportunity for both the healing of the person who was wronged and the betterment of the person in the wrong, and which may result in the disempowerment of everyone involved in ensuing drama.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c15"><span>Of course, restorative justice requires the participation of the accused, and in some cases, when private restoration has been attempted but is failing, it may be necessary to e</span><span>scalate to punishment, &ldquo;calling out,&rdquo; or a period of exclusion</span><span class="c1">.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c15"><span>But restorative justice often succeeds, in my own experience and that of others, and it&rsquo;s what we all want for ourselves when we make mistakes. Because of my own efforts in restorative justice, several people who may have lasting influence in my communities are now more capable allies than they would have been if I had behaved retributively in response to their poor behavior towards me. Instead, they made efforts to understand, make amends, and improve. Private efforts in restoration can take great patience and compassion on the part of the wronged, and that may feel unfair, but the only way we change people is by giving them the opportunity to grow away from the harmful misunderstandings and behaviors that a prejudiced society has taught them, just as we give that opportunity to everyone who used to eat animals or engage in other speciesist and harmful behavior towards nonhumans but pulled their way out of that enculturation &mdash; including almost every one of us as farmed animal advocates.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c16 c17"></span></p><p class="c15"><span>Restoration takes a lot more fortitude and effort in the short run than retribution, but when both the accuser and accused participate it seems to ultimately result in a lot less fighting, stress, time, and harm on all sides, and helps us build a strong and healthy community where people are encouraged to come together and grow rather than a weak and unstable one where we divide and stagnate.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>So I hope we have the fortitude to work hard for restoration and positive-sum outcomes, even when we&rsquo;re wounded and rightly frustrated. And I hope we have the courage to accept when our efforts are failing and there will not be a cooperative, healthy resolution, and the resolve to push forward to the least bad outcomes when we fail to reach good ones.</span></p><h2 class="c13" id="h.uf4zqchv1mdr"><span class="c4 c11">Developments this year</span></h2><p class="c15"><span>This year, the animal advocacy movement took up the #metoo movement and made notable progress on sexual harassment.

The study&rsquo;s methodology also found work sample tests to be poor predictors of job performance, which is suspect as in theory they should very directly measure task performance, and one could choose to measure on-the-job performance by a very similar metric (e.g. a work sample test could be to write an article, and an objective task performance metric on the job could be an evaluation of an article written on the job) just as readily as they might use supervisory ratings. That low ranking of work sample tests and the study&rsquo;s reliance on supervisory ratings may merely show that supervisors are poor judges of task performance or fail to consider it heavily in their evaluations.
