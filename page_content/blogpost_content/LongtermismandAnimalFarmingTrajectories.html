In this case, while some hens may have lived better lives during those 6 years, no hens are living in better housing due to this campaign after 6 years. In this case, other moral progress (e.g. cage-free campaigns in other countries) would continue in either scenario, leading to a positive slope in either scenario. Slope rubber banding could occur if the cage-free campaign inspires campaigns in other countries, and that inspiration is met with equal and opposite reversion, but the original cage-free switch is not reverted. In that case, the progress will continue to increase moral value accrued over time by those hens living better lives, but the value produced in year 10 would be no more than the value produced in year 7.
