To argue against a conclusion, as opposed to just showing that we should have limited confidence in it, a debater needs to either (i) bring up additional, stronger evidence that weighs against the conclusion or (ii) argue that the initial evidence is actually evidence against the purported conclusion, not in favor of it.</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">For example, say someone thinks that handing out vegan leaflets is a more promising intervention than giving talks on humane education because of an experiment on vegan leafleting where the treatment group had 3% lower animal product consumption than a group who watched a humane education talk. Someone else could criticize this study for having a low sample size, potential social desirability bias, and other issues, but it would be wrong of them to dismiss the evidence entirely, unless the study was so biased that its effect size is likely more than 3% greater than it is in reality, in which case a 3% difference would actually be evidence against leafleting&rsquo;s effectiveness.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Essentially, weakness of evidence does not imply an effect in the opposite direction, or even agnosticism between the two directions. It just means our confidence in the conclusion should be low. Perhaps our concerns about the experiment should make us discount the real effect size all the way down to 0.1%, but even that is still some evidence in favor of leafleting. If we need to make a decision about whether a large charity runs a leafleting or humane education program, and they&rsquo;re unwilling to choose a third option,</span><sup><a href="#ftnt2" id="ftnt_ref2">[2]</a></sup><span class="c5">&nbsp;then that 0.1% difference could make a difference of thousands or more animals.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Both parties could also present additional evidence. Maybe that additional evidence is just speculation and intuition, which are plausibly more robust evidence than some of the existing experiments in the animal advocacy field. If someone thinks that behavior change based on an intervention as small as a leaflet is very unlikely, they might favor humane education because extended interactions seem to that person to be much more likely to lead to behavior change.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>We can visualize this by comparing evidence-based reasoning to using a scale with physical weights</span><span class="c5">, where evidence accumulates on each side of a debate (the left or the right platform of the scale) and our conclusion is based on which side is heavier. So here&rsquo;s what a debate would look like before we get any evidence:</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c12"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 400.00px; height: 400.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image3.png" style="width: 400.00px; height: 400.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Once we get a piece of evidence, such as a study on a particular strategy, the scale leans towards that conclusion:</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c12"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 400.00px; height: 400.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image2.png" style="width: 400.00px; height: 400.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">What happens when that evidence weakens, perhaps because we find out about a surprisingly low sample size or other methodological concerns?</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c12"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 400.00px; height: 400.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image4.png" style="width: 400.00px; height: 400.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">The evidence loses some of its weight, but no evidence was added to the other side of the scale, so it doesn&rsquo;t tip in the other direction.

In the real world, evidence can sit on different points across a single, wide platform. You could have one study that suggests a 4% increase in vegetarianism, a 2% increase, and a -5% increase. You would then have weights for each piece of evidence, based on their methodology, design, etc., and would then conclude a certain effect size &mdash; in this case 0.33% if the weights are the same.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">A good rule-of-thumb in EAA discussions is: If you want to criticize someone&rsquo;s evidence for being mere speculation, intuition, or otherwise weak, you should either (i) say explicitly that you are just criticizing the explanation of the evidence, e.g. someone says &ldquo;Leaflets are effective!&rdquo; and you think it&rsquo;s more accurate and worth the extra words to say &ldquo;The evidence weakly weighs in favor of leafleting,&rdquo; or (ii) introduce additional evidence, and argue why that evidence might be stronger than the critiqued evidence, even if the additional evidence you bring up is also just speculation and intuition.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">It&rsquo;s much easier to criticize the strength of a piece of evidence than to contribute new evidence (for instance, by running a new study). Criticism can also make a person seem intelligent and can help them easily reinforce a position they already held. For these reasons, it seems like the EAA research community should generally spend less time criticizing the strength of evidence and more time seeking out, analyzing, and aggregating new evidence.</span></p><h3 class="c14" id="h.px34qxc94k7i"><span class="c13">But isn&rsquo;t the strong evidence, e.g. randomized experiments, so much stronger that we should just ignore speculation and intuition, even if should theoretically have non-zero weight?</span></h3><p class="c1"><span>Unfortunately there is little evidence for effective advocacy strategies that is as strong as, for instance, the best evidence in fields like history and psychology. Even in advocacy areas other than helping animals that have been the subject of more exhaustive scientific study, such as increasing voter turnout, many strategic decisions still rely heavily on speculation and intuition because we simply can&rsquo;t run randomized controlled trials or similarly conclusive studies on all the outcomes we care about.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt3" id="ftnt_ref3">[3]</a></sup></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">If we measure immediate conversion to vegetarianism in animal advocacy, or individual voter turnout in a Get Out The Vote campaign, we&rsquo;re still not seeing outcomes like long-term diet change, activist creation, or the impact of subjects on their communities and society as a whole, such as through media coverage. We have to rely on weaker evidence for those outcomes.
