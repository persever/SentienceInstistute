In contrast, social change can move backwards, i.e. attitudes and human behavior could become</span><span>&nbsp;worse than they used to be</span><span>. </span><span>This suggests that work on social change is more likely to affect the direction of the future, e.g. whether animal farming ever ends, than work on improving food technology.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt111" id="ftnt_ref111">[111]</a></sup></li></ol><ol class="c11 lst-kix_5u40fey240fl-1 start" start="1"><li class="c6"><span>The importance of this argument is affected by how you weigh long-term versus short-term </span><span>impacts</span><span>.

This suggests that quality matters less.</span></li><li class="c12"><span>Some researchers, such as those at the Open Philanthropy Project and Animal Charity Evaluators, are skeptical about cellular agriculture products getting to market in the near future.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt112" id="ftnt_ref112">[112]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ftnt113" id="ftnt_ref113">[113]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;This suggests that we might need to depend on social change to help farmed animals, at least in the near future</span><span>.</span></li><li class="c12"><span>There is some historical evidence for activism as an important driver of technology adoption. Positive news coverage seemed to encourage positive public opinion of nuclear power in Germany.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt114" id="ftnt_ref114">[114]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;The Sierra Club&rsquo;s Beyond Coal campaign in the 2010s, which &ldquo;campaigned for new federal rules on coal plants and subsidies for renewables, and organized communities to oppose new coal plants and shutter old ones,&rdquo; seems to have been successful in reducing US coal production and encouraging the adoption of other technologies.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt115" id="ftnt_ref115">[115]</a></sup></li><li class="c12"><span class="c8">There is some historical evidence that social, regulatory, and economic factors can delay or reverse the adoption of a profitable new technology. GMO researchers, for example, felt confident that GMOs would spread rapidly once developed, improving the sustainability and quality of the global food system. However, GM foods were rejected or blocked in major world markets like Europe and Africa, and today GMOs have failed to spread widely or to dramatically improve the global agricultural system.</span><sup class="c8 c22"><a href="#ftnt116" id="ftnt_ref116">[116]</a></sup></li></ol><h4 class="c3" id="h.4jztveykn34p"><span class="c10 c22">Arguments for food technology</span></h4><ol class="c11 lst-kix_rdiq4cr6tvu6-0 start" start="1"><li class="c12"><span>In the same vein as the first argument above, t</span><span>here are some ways for technology to affect the direction of the far future e</span><span>ven if there is monotonically increasing technological progress</span><span>.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt117" id="ftnt_ref117">[117]</a></sup></li></ol><ol class="c11 lst-kix_rdiq4cr6tvu6-1 start" start="1"><li class="c6"><span>The importance of this argument is affected by how you weigh long-term versus short-term </span><span>impacts</span><span class="c1">. If you care more about short-term impact, then the direction of future progress matters less.</span></li><li class="c6"><span>One example is that </span><span>if we think highly-advanced artificial intelligence or other advanced technology will arrive soon and take control of the universe, the values of society at the time of arrival might be very important, such that we just want to improve values as </span><span>much as possible as </span><span>quickly as possible</span><span>&nbsp;because advocates&rsquo; ability to effect change would stop when the artificial intelligence arrives. </span><span>And some technology m</span><span>ight offer a quicker improvement to society&rsquo;s values than social change, even if in the long run the social change might result in more significant or more robust value improvements</span><span>.</span></li><li class="c6"><span class="c1">Another example is that speeding up animal-free food technology could result in social change, e.g. once people stop eating animals they might subsequently care more about them, and achieving this quickly frees up modern animal advocacy efforts to do more to change attitudes in further ways, e.g. by helping people care about non-anthropogenic suffering.</span></li></ol><ol class="c11 lst-kix_rdiq4cr6tvu6-2 start" start="1"><li class="c15 c41"><span>The importance of this argument is affected by how much you think we&rsquo;re in a &ldquo;golden age&rdquo; of animal advocacy. If you think there will be much less animal advocacy, say, 100 years from now, then hastening technological progress in order to take advantage of this opportunity to multiply our impact (e.g. there&rsquo;s a friendlier political climate, more advocates eager to help with projects), which we won&rsquo;t have after the golden age, could matter much more.</span></li><li class="c15 c41"><span class="c8">Animal-free products may need to be the same as or extremely similar to their animal-based counterparts before society is at a comparable point to other social movements where we&rsquo;re ready to successfully push for changes to production.</span></li></ol><ol class="c11 lst-kix_rdiq4cr6tvu6-0" start="2"><li class="c12"><span class="c1">Technological work could leverage private interest from corporations, investors, and entrepreneurs (resources that are otherwise unavailable to the movement), e.g. if you did the early-stage research, you could count on others to finish it and commercialize the product if you showed them it was a promising opportunity.</span></li><li class="c12"><span class="c1">Social change might be less tractable, partly because it&rsquo;s harder to measure one&rsquo;s progress. It might be prohibitively challenging to convince others to make a significant change like switching many of the foods they eat or adjusting their identities to become antispeciesist, so what&rsquo;s most needed could be to make going vegan or opposing harm to animals require less of a transition cost for people (e.g. with better plant-based meats).</span></li><li class="c12"><span class="c1">Arguably technology has been more neglected, perhaps due in part to some animal advocates thinking that if they just show the public how animals are treated and offer solid ethical arguments, people will change.</span></li><li class="c12"><span class="c7 c29 c8">Moral circles may trend towards a setpoint, and if so it seems like that&rsquo;s most likely a point that includes the most powerful beings and excludes those whose inclusion would not increase the society&rsquo;s power, or in other words excludes those who are more of a burden and cost more resources to care for than they contribute to the selfish interests of the powerful. At present that most powerful group is humans, or at least many humans, and though we&rsquo;ve historically expanded the circle to include more humans, further expansion to beings like chickens, fish, and grasshoppers doesn&rsquo;t reap the same benefits to powerful humans like the economic progress seen with women&rsquo;s empowerment and the decreased violent conflict seen with increased cooperation between ethnic groups. Therefore, expanding humanity&rsquo;s moral circle beyond humanity may be very challenging and as such technological solutions to nonhuman suffering may be more tractable.</span></li><li class="c12"><span class="c7 c8 c29">Businesses and academic environments (which are usually where technology development occurs) seem to be more efficient than activist environments, especially grassroots, because activists spend so much overhead on community maintenance. For example, because activists often have more overlap between their social circles and professional circles, so those professional circles tend to be more casual, activists end up dealing with more interpersonal issues with time that could be otherwise spent on direct work.</span></li><li class="c12"><span class="c7 c29 c8">Activist environments might be beneficial in some ways, such as more camaraderie and dedication that allows them to better endure setbacks like a failed policy campaign or slow adoption of animal-free foods.</span></li></ol>
