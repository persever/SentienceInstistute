<h2>Researcher</h2>
<h3>Application Deadline: July 31, 2020</h3>
<p>
  We're looking for a researcher to work with us on understanding moral circle expansion and related social phenomena. This position offers a large amount of flexibility with few requirements other than the production of high-quality research that fits within <a href="https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/mission">our mission</a>. We are open to a variety of social science methods: qualitative (e.g. historical case studies, interviews, conceptual analysis) or quantitative (e.g. nationally representative surveys, behavioral experiments, analysis of existing industry and survey data). Since founding SI in 2017, we have primarily focused on farmed animals as the current frontier of humanity's moral circle. We expect our future research on farmed animal issues to be similar to our previous research, which is listed on <a href="https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/research">this page</a>. We also have some ideas for future research listed in our <a href="https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/research-agenda">research agenda</a> that may be of interest to applicants.
</p>
<p>
  However, given our three years of research that has grabbed some of the low-hanging fruit on the topic of farmed animals, we would be eager to hire someone with an interest in other moral circle expansion topics. The main area we have in mind here is artificial sentience: robots, machines, and other entities made by humans that are able to experience happiness or suffering. For example, SI may run a nationally representative survey of US adults on their attitudes towards artificial sentience and related topics. In addition to artificial sentience, examples of possible research topics include the moral inclusion of wild animals and historical examples of moral circle expansion (analyzed without a specific current or future expansion in mind, focusing instead on a general understanding of moral inclusion processes).
<p>
  While we want all of our research to be thoroughly vetted and publically available, we are open to different publication formats. Our previous publications have been reports (i.e. white papers, working papers), academic journal articles, blog posts, newspaper and magazine articles, conference presentations, and a book. The best publication format depends partly on the content and audience of the work, but we also want to consider how we can support early-career researchers working on the topic of moral circle expansion, and some publication formats may be more useful for their professional development. In addition to research publication, an SI researcher may engage in other research-related activities, including but not limited to administrative work, interviews and media commentary, and meeting with and advising organizations who are interested in our research findings.

</p>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>Collaborate with our team to decide what projects, especially those on our <a href="http://www.sentienceinstitute.org/research-agenda">research agenda</a>, to work on.</li>
    <li>Conduct that research fairly independently, typically with regular check-ins and peer review prior to publication. Frequent questions and meetings will be expected at the beginning, but should slow down over time as you become more familiar with the research literature and methods.</li>
    <li>Provide assistance as needed with other research projects and ideas, mainly by reviewing research for accuracy, clarity, quality of the reasoning, and overlooked evidence.</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  Since weâ€™re a small organization, depending on your individual preferences and abilities, you may also have opportunities to take on other organizational tasks, though that is by no means an expectation of researchers and is merely an opportunity for those who are interested.

  <ul>
    <li>Several years of research and writing experience in academia, think tanks, or another research institution</li>
