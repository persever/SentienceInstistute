Only 23% of U.S. adults trust AI companies to put safety over profits, and 27% trust the creators of an AI to maintain control of current and future versions. This translates to widespread support for slowdowns and regulation, such as 63% support for banning artificial general intelligence that is smarter than humans, according to nationally representative surveys conducted by the nonprofit research organization Sentience Institute.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">People expect AI to come very soon.

If AIs become sentient, a surprisingly large number of people think we should take at least some steps to protect their welfare&mdash;71% agree that sentient AIs &ldquo;deserve to be treated with respect,&rdquo; and 38% are in favor of legal rights.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">Preregistered predictions show that there was surprisingly high moral concern for sentient AI and a surprisingly high view of them as having a mind (i.e., &ldquo;mind perception&rdquo;). Using index measures in 2021 and 2023, we found significant increases in moral concern, mind perception, perceived threat, and support for banning sentience-related AI technologies. Two single-item measures also showed significantly shorter timelines for sentient AI from 2021 to 2023.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c5"><span>This</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;provides landmark public opinion data from before to after 2022, a major year for AI in which people like Google engineer Blake Lemoine raised the possibility that current AIs may be sentient, and groundbreaking AI systems were launched such as Stable Diffusion and ChatGPT.
