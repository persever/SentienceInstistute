boundary around entities that are granted moral consideration. At the most basic level, Sentience Institute thinks of the moral circle as a series of concentric circles, as shown in Figure 1. Entities in the </span><span class="c5">inner circle</span><span>&nbsp;are granted full moral consideration: their interests are fully taken into account in moral decision-making. Entities in the </span><span class="c5">outer circle</span><span>&nbsp;are granted a moderate level of moral consideration, but their interests are devalued relative to those in the inner circle. At the </span><span class="c5">frontiers of the circle</span><span>, entities are granted minimal moral consideration, and those </span><span class="c5">outside of the circle</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;are granted no moral consideration at all.

We can consider a person&rsquo;s </span><span class="c5">attitudinal</span><span>, or </span><span class="c5">self-reported</span><span>, moral circle &mdash; what they think their moral circle should look like, and their </span><span class="c5">behavioral</span><span>, or </span><span class="c5">choice-based</span><span>, moral circle &mdash; how they treat other entities. We can also distinguish between an individual&rsquo;s </span><span class="c5">personal</span><span>&nbsp;moral circle &mdash; how they personally act (or think they should act) towards different entities, and the </span><span class="c5">societal</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;moral circle &mdash; how society as a whole treats different entities, or how people think society should treat different entities. Moreover, in most conceptions, it is not a circle per se. It spans across many dimensions and has holes and protrusions, such as apparently distant groups that are given uniquely high moral concern, and gradients rather than distinct categories of concern. Consider, for example, the treatment of Bald Eagles in the U.S., where they are a national bird and symbol, despite birds generally being on the frontiers or outside of the moral circle.</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>At Sentience Institute, we are mainly interested in the societal moral circle. This captures the laws, policies, and norms that are intended to protect the interests of different entities.

Note that this does not mean we think all sentient entities should be treated in exactly the same way. Different entities have different interests. Being in the inner circle means an entity&rsquo;s specific set of interests are given full moral consideration, not that they are treated in exactly the same way as others in the circle.</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Currently, society&rsquo;s moral circle looks quite different from our vision of all sentient beings in the inner circle. The actual moral circle spans across many dimensions other than sentience. For example, society grants moral consideration based on factors such as an entity&rsquo;s location in space, their location in time, their species, their substrate, whether their experience is the result of an act or an omission, the cause of the entity&rsquo;s experience, and what an entity is believed to deserve</span><sup class="c23"><a href="#ftnt1" id="ftnt_ref1">[1]</a></sup><span class="c7">. Intrinsically, Sentience Institute considers all of these factors to be irrelevant, though there may be instrumental reasons to care about some of them if doing so would benefit sentient beings.</span></p><h1 class="c10" id="h.1fob9te"><span class="c21 c19">Effective Altruism</span></h1><p class="c1"><span>How should we approach the task of expanding society&rsquo;s moral circle to include all sentient beings?

Effective altruism aims to generate the most positive impact with the available resources. Ideally, we would help all sentient beings that need it right away, but in reality, resources are scarce and we must make decisions about how to allocate them.</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Having the largest impact with our resources requires us to define what we mean by &ldquo;impact.&rdquo; Sentience Institute is focused on the </span><span class="c6"><a class="c2" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/well-being/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1628847215405000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0MZsb0qxD6pfXMmN8V0QG9">wellbeing</a></span><span>&nbsp;of sentient entities.

Still, we think that an important way of respecting the interests of sentient beings is by recognizing them as legal persons, such as the endowment of legal rights and standing.
