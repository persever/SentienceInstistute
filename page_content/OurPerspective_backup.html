Sentience Institute, we focus on &ldquo;effective altruism,&rdquo; meaning the strategies and tactics that generate the most positive impact for the amount of resources used. We do this because there are many sentient beings who need our help, but we lack the time, money, and other resources to fully help all of them. We need </span><span class="c7 c16"><a class="c2" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://80000hours.org/2012/06/on-triage/">triage</a></span><span class="c6">. Intuitively, we might feel inclined to pursue strategies that are the most appealing to us personally, the easiest to implement, or whose impacts are easiest to measure, but if we instead pursue more effective strategies we can help many more individuals and spare much more suffering.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c3"><span>This focus on effectiveness can feel &ldquo;cold&rdquo; because humans face a </span><span class="c7 c16"><a class="c2" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21219076">collapse of compassion</a></span><span>&nbsp;when faced with large, seemingly insurmountable issues like the estimated 100 billion or more animals </span><span class="c7 c16"><a class="c2" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Njl_GS7jDOELjOtywvk3thIFpW_v10uZ5APJl1KgaY0/">being raised for food globally</a></span><span class="c6">. The limits of our imaginations make it impossible for us to see 100,000,000,000 individuals in the detail with which we see humans or animals we know personally. Instead we just see a number, a drastically reductive representation of those 100,000,000,000 individuals. But each and every number in that sum represents an entire individual with a personality and unique experiences, and most of them are suffering severely. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">Fully empathizing with all who need our help and helping as much as possible means extending what feels like the &ldquo;warm&rdquo; understanding of individuals we know personally to these large populations. As opposed to &ldquo;cold and calculating,&rdquo; a better term for this radically equitable consideration of everyone we can impact might be &ldquo;warm and calculating.&rdquo; In fact, to us it seems much colder to only consider a few individuals and abandon so many more whom we could help.</span></p><h2 class="c14" id="h.r2djgs617bxf"><span class="c23">Expanding the moral circle</span></h2><p class="c3"><span class="c6">It&rsquo;s important for us to question the typical factors that prevent us from properly respecting the interests of other individuals. Society has made significant progress in accounting for some of these, like race and gender differences, but there are other dimensions that few of us consider:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6"></span></p><ul class="c21 lst-kix_e91jkfsw4tt7-0 start"><li class="c3 c11 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4">Location</span><span class="c6">: We don&rsquo;t see the suffering of those far away, which makes it easy for us to ignore their suffering, even though they have morally relevant experiences that are just as important to them as ours are to us. This is especially important for those of us in high-income countries who rarely think about the wellbeing of people in distant, low-income countries.</span></li></ul><p class="c0"><span class="c6"></span></p><ul class="c21 lst-kix_e91jkfsw4tt7-0"><li class="c3 c11 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4">Time</span><span class="c6">: Many children who have not even been conceived yet will be born in the coming decades, and the decisions we make now about democratic processes or pollution or education could help or hurt them after we&rsquo;re gone. Similarly, a vegetarian won&rsquo;t refuse to eat a chicken because their action will help that particular chicken, who is already dead, but because it might prevent another chicken from suffering.</span></li></ul><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c27"></span></p><ul class="c21 lst-kix_e91jkfsw4tt7-0"><li class="c3 c11 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4">Acts vs. Omissions</span><span class="c6">: Harmful acts like murder and physical assault may be obviously wrong, but inaction (i.e. omissions) can lead to the same negative consequences for the sentient individuals affected. The canonical thought experiment here is to imagine walking by a shallow pond on your way to work: You&rsquo;re wearing expensive clothing, worth perhaps a few hundred or thousand dollars. In the pond, you see a small child drowning. If you dive in now, you can save them, but at the cost of your clothes. It seems like the right thing to do is clearly to save her, even though you are not the one who put her in the pond.

While it does seem that some farms are much less harmful from an animal welfare perspective,</span><span>&nbsp;we oppose animal farming as a whole </span><span>and would like to see a transition towards wholly animal-free food production, for a few reasons.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c3"><span>First, </span><span>undercover investigations and other inquiries into the conditions of so-called &ldquo;humane&rdquo; farms </span><span>have shown that most of these farms are still places of </span><span>intense </span><span>suffering, and </span><span>it doesn&rsquo;t seem like</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>most of </span><span>the</span><span>se</span><span>&nbsp;animals live live</span><span>s</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>worth living (i.e. a life that one would choose to live over nonexistence)</span><span>. Our co-founders</span><span>&nbsp;themselves joined a professional animal rescue team at a farm with </span><span>organic, pasture</span><span>-</span><span>raised egg-laying hens, which from the nearby road</span><span>&nbsp;looked</span><span>&nbsp;as picturesque as the farms in the most bucolic advertisements, </span><span>but </span><span>on closer inspection we learned that </span><span>the animals </span><span>ha</span><span>d</span><span>&nbsp;internal and external parasites, blindness, bone deformities, neurological damage</span><span>,</span><span>&nbsp;and lung infections from diseases that went untreated. As all hens bred to lay eggs, they were also all</span><span>&nbsp;constantly anxious due to their overactive reproductive systems and daily hormonal fluctuations. They also had to experience the pain of laying large eggs on a near-daily basis, </span><span>and many had already died from severe reproductive illnesses and ailments such as cancer, stuck eggs, broken eggs, and oviduct infections, all which went entirely untreated. The farmhand told us that we &ldquo;wouldn&rsquo;t believe&rdquo; how many were killed by predators, a given in pasture farms with limited shelter and no trees to hide in.</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;This is just one example of a picture-perfect, &ldquo;humane&rdquo; animal farm.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c3"><span>Second, the idea that there is a humane way to farm animals, even if true in a very small percentage of cases, may provide people with a psychological refuge that ultimately makes them more accepting of all animal farming, even if the vast majority of it happens in factory farms. Activists frequently hear people say they don&rsquo;t eat meat and animal-based products from bad farms, but when asked about their actual consumption habits, they admit that only a small fraction are actually from something labelled even merely &ldquo;cage-free,&rdquo; &ldquo;sustainable,&rdquo; &ldquo;natural,&rdquo; etc., which</span><span>&nbsp;do not correlate with the bucolic conditions the consumer imagines</span><span>.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c3"><span>Third, we suspect it is highly unlikely that society could eliminate only factory farms </span><span>while still maintaining anywhere close to modern levels of animal product consumption</span><span>. </span><span>E</span><span>ven with a </span><span>halving of global consumption due to regulations or consumer choices, a non-factory system would likely involve very high costs for consumers, higher than the cost of current so-called &ldquo;humanely raised&rdquo; animal products. Producers would have strong incentives to cut corners, as farmed animals are unable to organize and protest their treatment like human laborers do, so an extensive oversight system with inspections and close monitoring would be required. Shifting industry practices to this extent would require extremely strong political and consumer pressure, which seems particularly unlikely given the </span><span class="c7 c16"><a class="c2" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0146167211424291">cognitive dissonance</a></span><span>&nbsp;people experience when eating animals while caring about animals</span><span>.</span><span>&nbsp;The alternative to our current factory farming system that seems much more promising is to replace animal farming altogether with more resource-efficient and truly &ldquo;humane&rdquo; animal-free meat, dairy, and eggs.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c3"><span>Fourth, if </span><span>humanity continues using animals for food, those animals will continue to be seen at least to an extent as objects and a means to our own ends. We believe that sentient beings are more likely to have their wellbeing fully considered when they are seen as individuals with their own interests, instead of as commodities. This suggests that ending the commodification of these and other animals could further help other sentient beings who will need our help in the future.</span><span>&nbsp;To that end it is important that we address entire institutions and not just the particularly bad practices</span><span>&nbsp;within them</span><span class="c6">.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c3"><span>We also discuss the case against animal farming in a </span><span class="c7 c16"><a class="c2" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.theguardian.com/food/2018/nov/16/theres-no-such-thing-as-humane-meat-or-eggs-stop-kidding-yourself">book excerpt</a></span><span>&nbsp;in </span><span class="c1">The Guardian</span><span>, and in the book, </span><span class="c7 c16 c1"><a class="c2" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://jacyanthis.com/book">The End of Animal Farming</a></span><span class="c6">.</span></p><h1 class="c9" id="h.ub8xnkd3szg3"><span>P</span><span>rioritizing sentient wellbeing</span></h1><p class="c3"><span class="c6">Discussions of morality often include a diverse set of values like justice, tradition, rights, sanctity, duty, patriotism, loyalty, respect, honor, and liberty. We believe some of these are useful standards for everyday moral discussion, but such values often conflict. If one has to steal a loaf of bread from a store to feed their starving family, what comes first: their family, the law, or the rights of storekeeper? We believe that the determining factor of moral questions should be the welfare of all sentient beings involved. This does not lead to easy answers, but it gives us a useful standard for making difficult moral decisions.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">This is especially important when it comes to the welfare of humans and animals who suffer from natural causes, i.e. from causes other than the actions of humans. In the case of humans, this is a rather obvious conclusion: If someone is suffering from an infection of tuberculosis, a natural ailment, treating them with antibiotics is clearly the right call. To that human, the suffering is clearly a very bad thing. The experience itself, and not where the disease came from, is what matters.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c3"><span>Emphasizing consequences to individuals&rsquo; wellbeing forces us to consider wild animals in a way that many may find counterintuitive. </span><span>There are an enormous number of animals in the wild, and many of them suffer in ways </span><span>unheard of by many humans.</span><span>&nbsp;Intense competition for resources means that starvation is a common occurrence. Illnesses and injuries </span><span>go untreated, e</span><span>xtreme weather cripples and kills the exposed, and children and families are routinely separated</span><span>.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Most individuals die young after a short and painful life, and </span><span class="c6">only a very small minority are able to lead something like the pleasant life we typically imagine.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c3"><span>One of the intuitions people have about this suffering is that any attempt to intervene in the wild will go badly, based on the track record humans have of pollution and habitat destruction. But humanity has</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>made</span><span>&nbsp;very few interventions with the intent of helping wild animals, and those few we have, such as the distribution of </span><span class="c7 c19"><a class="c2" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildlife_contraceptive">contraceptives</a></span><span>&nbsp;and the construction of </span><span class="c7 c19"><a class="c2" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildlife_crossing">wildlife crossings</a></span><span class="c6">, have been limited in scope and have also generally only been taken because they were instrumental to humans. There simply isn&rsquo;t a precedent to base such a judgement on. Many of us are sympathetic to the rescue and rehabilitation of individual wild animals who are in need of help, regardless of the cause of their suffering, and we need to take care to avoid the collapse of our compassion when the number of victims is greater.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c3"><span>Environmentalist rhetoric often involves appealing to the preservation of nonsentient entities such as a species, ecosystem, or habitat, and while these may at times be useful proxies for sentient wellbeing, they are not sufficient and may even prevent us from doing what&rsquo;s best for wild animals themselves.</span><span>&nbsp;In the interest of their wellbeing, we need to</span><span>&nbsp;shift our mindset and conduct substantial research into effective strategies to reduce their suffering. W</span><span>e encourage others to develop concern for the wellbeing of these individuals </span><span>in the way we have concern</span><span>&nbsp;for humans suffering in ways that no one intentionally caused and which they have no means of preventing without our help. If society can adopt such concern for wild animals&rsquo; wellbeing, we will be better prepared to take action when we develop the technological capability</span><span>&nbsp;and scientific understanding</span><span>&nbsp;to</span><span>&nbsp;help them</span><span class="c6">.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c3"><span>For more detailed discussion of this perspective on wild animal wellbeing, see </span><span class="c7 c16"><a class="c2" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://foundational-research.org/the-importance-of-wild-animal-suffering/">this paper</a></span><span>&nbsp;by Brian Tomasik at the Foundational Research Institute.

The difference is that persons have rights, and things don&rsquo;t. One of the main methods and indications of moral circle expansion in human history has been the inclusion of more and more humans as legal persons. We&rsquo;ve seen this with the abolition of slavery, the passage of child labor laws, the franchisement of women, and many more important social movements.
