Also, farmed animal advocates are already engaged in a variety of ongoing institutional tactics which people can be asked to support. General antispeciesism could include these calls to action, but given its broadness, its calls to action are less closely tied to the message. A wild animal focus has less clear calls to action, but still some, such as donating to organizations working on the issue, conducting further research, and helping individual wild animals, e.g. at rehabilitation centers.</span></p><h4 class="c13" id="h.5r7vvikpx38c"><span class="c40">Divergence from preservation arguments and association with preservationist ideas</span><sup><a href="#cmnt63" id="cmnt_ref63">[bk]</a></sup></h4><ol class="c20 lst-kix_bmioc9ekgl89-0 start" start="1"><li class="c1 c5"><span class="c2">Wild animal focus, general antispeciesism</span></li><li class="c1 c5"><span class="c2">Farmed animal focus</span></li></ol><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Explanation: EAAs tend to care more about the wellbeing of sentient individuals than the preservation of nonsentient entities such as landscapes and ecosystems. Environmental arguments against animal agriculture are common, and modern environmentalism is often grounded more in preservation than wellbeing, so a farmed animal focus runs a risk of furthering that preservationist ideology relative to a wellbeing-focused perspective.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt211" id="ftnt_ref211">[211]</a></sup></p><h4 class="c13" id="h.8j0d3plcso3w"><span class="c15 c22">Unclear direction: Tractability of spreading the idea</span></h4><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Explanation: Helping farmed animals is probably a more established cause in mainstream discourse as measured by, say, number of articles on the topic in major news outlets.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt212" id="ftnt_ref212">[212]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;Similarly, there seems to have been more rapid growth in farmed animal concern and discussion of the problem than explicit mentions of antispeciesm or reducing wild animal suffering. Antispeciesism is limited somewhat in tractability by its abstract nature. For people to accept that we should help wild animals, they need some concern for those animals as well as a willingness to take action against harms that happen in nature, which is difficult for many people to accept.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt213" id="ftnt_ref213">[213]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ftnt214" id="ftnt_ref214">[214]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;One counter-consideration is that people regularly participate in farmed animal cruelty by eating animal products, while they don&rsquo;t participate in wild animal suffering, at least in a similarly direct way. If farmed animal advocacy is closely related to the promotion of animal-free food technology, then preferences for naturalness may be a substantial barrier here too.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt215" id="ftnt_ref215">[215]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;There is some anecdotal evidence that attendees of antispeciesist lectures accept the arguments for antispeciesism, indicating tractability.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt216" id="ftnt_ref216">[216]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;Lecturers on farmed and wild animal advocacy also report attendees saying they are convinced by the arguments, though Oscar Horta notes that in his presentations, the discussion of veganism (which is not necessarily synonymous with discussion of farmed animals &mdash; see the individual vs. institutional change section) is the most contentious.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt217" id="ftnt_ref217">[217]</a></sup></p><h4 class="c13" id="h.syct5slh38n"><span class="c15 c22">Unclear direction: Relatively strong appeal to intellectuals</span></h4><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Explanation: Because antispeciesism is a more abstract, sophisticated idea it could have greater appeal to intellectuals relative to its appeal to the general population.</span></p><h4 class="c13" id="h.ec1ns5e2cjaw"><span class="c15 c22">Unclear direction: Alignment with utilitarianism</span></h4><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Explanation: When people hear about or discuss farmed animal welfare, they usually focus on the wellbeing of individuals, either in terms of their suffering or the dissatisfaction of their preferences. Wild animal advocacy is usually individual-centric, but people often assume helping wild animals involves pursuing goals other than directly utilitarian ones, such as the preservation of a species. General antispeciesism is sometimes advocated for in utilitarian terms, but the concept of not discriminating across species doesn&rsquo;t come loaded with a specific vision of how other individuals should be treated other than just that it shouldn&rsquo;t depend on species identity.</span></p><h4 class="c13" id="h.dw53kja9gxjj"><span class="c15 c22">Unclear direction: Association of antispeciesism with social justice and left-wing politics</span></h4><p class="c1"><span>Explanation: Antispeciesism in particular comes across as a very left-wing idea given its association with anti-racism, anti-sexism, etc. This could be a good or bad thing depending on how much you think animal advocates should focus on appealing to the mainstream left relative to a bipartisan audience. A possible counterargument here is that left-wingers might be particularly defensive about the inclusion of animals in their discussions because they want to avoid diluting their focus on oppressed humans or because they have developed their identities more around human rights than around general nondiscrimination.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt218" id="ftnt_ref218">[218]</a></sup><span class="c2">&nbsp;Some EAA researchers think that counterargument is quite compelling.</span></p><h2 class="c24" id="h.ofv2osgk3gjt"><span>[meta] Long-term vs. short-term focus</span><sup><a href="#cmnt64" id="cmnt_ref64">[bl]</a></sup></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Explanation: Should we give more weight to long-term outcomes or short-term outcomes? A useful place to draw the line between the short- and long-term is at the end of animal farming, e.g. when humanity has such advanced technology that we no longer eat animals simply because they are inefficient ways to get meat, milk, and eggs.
