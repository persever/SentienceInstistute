c23">Individual and small group educational and supportive behavioral interventions</span></h1><h2 class="c7" id="h.rqeqt54qhlm2"><span class="c1 c13">Education or information only</span></h2><p class="c10"><span class="c0">In health behavior interventions, educational content is often integrated with behavioral support or advice. For example, the authors of one Cochrane review note that, &ldquo;[i]n school settings, universal prevention [of alcohol use] typically takes the form of alcohol awareness education, social and peer resistance skills, normative feedback, or development of behavioural norms and positive peer affiliations.&rdquo;</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt1" id="ftnt_ref1">[1]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;However, some reviews evaluate interventions that are primarily focused on enhancing knowledge and affecting the &ldquo;rational determinants&rdquo; of behavior, rather than trying to provide behavioral support. This section focuses on such interventions, though separating educational from behavioral interventions for analysis can be an arbitrary process at times.</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt2" id="ftnt_ref2">[2]</a></sup></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c0">Overall there is moderate evidence from the health behavior literature that educational interventions are likely to be effective at changing behavior in the farmed animal movement.</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt3" id="ftnt_ref3">[3]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;Where behavioral outcomes are measured in meta-analyses, there are some wide confidence intervals (CIs), but point estimates tend to suggest small effect sizes.</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt4" id="ftnt_ref4">[4]</a></sup></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c0">Sometimes the control groups in educational intervention trials are provided with some information or education, of a level which seems more comparable with interventions currently used in the farmed animal movement, such as leafleting or online ads, and the intervention group receives content uncommon in activism, such as telephone or face-to-face counseling.</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt5" id="ftnt_ref5">[5]</a></sup><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;In this sense, the results of education intervention trials sometimes compare resource-intensive educational interventions to lower-cost educational interventions, rather than directly testing for the overall effects of educational interventions. There is little evidence for the effectiveness of lower-cost education interventions compared to zero intervention.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c0">Sometimes, reviews report that resource-intensive educational interventions improved knowledge outcomes but not behavioral outcomes;</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt6" id="ftnt_ref6">[6]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;the effects on behavioral outcomes, if any, might only have been detected with longer follow-up, or if combined with other intervention types. In this sense, knowledge may be an important moderator of behavioral change, but the evidence of long-term effects of educational interventions is very weak.</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt7" id="ftnt_ref7">[7]</a></sup></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c0">Three meta-analyses with behavioral outcomes at long-term follow-up suggested that small or very small effects were most likely; in one of these, the CI included no effect. Indirect comparisons in these meta-analyses found that short-term effects were very slightly larger than long-term effects, though the CIs suggest a wide range of possible differences in either direction.</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt8" id="ftnt_ref8">[8]</a></sup></p><h2 class="c7" id="h.v0m8qdm3f02a"><span class="c1 c13">Brief interventions (BIs)</span></h2><p class="c10"><span class="c0">Brief Interventions (BIs) do not have a strict definition, and the term can include educational or behavioral interventions varying from the single provision of a leaflet through to comparatively lengthy educational sessions; one review notes that BIs &ldquo;typically comprise a conversation of anywhere between 5 and 45 minutes.&rdquo;</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt9" id="ftnt_ref9">[9]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;They can incorporate a range of techniques, from information provision to behavioral advice, and often include motivational interviewing (MI) components. Despite this heterogeneity, in many ways, BIs are the interventions most comparable to the individual outreach often currently pursued by the farmed animal movement through leafleting, humane education, and one-on-one conversations during street activism. In the review focused on BIs for dietary behaviors, print materials and internet interventions were included,</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt10" id="ftnt_ref10">[10]</a></sup><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;although this did not seem to be the case in most of the included reviews of BIs. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c0">There is strong evidence from the health behavior literature that BIs are likely to be effective at changing behavior in the farmed animal movement.</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt11" id="ftnt_ref11">[11]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;Meta-analyses evaluating BIs tend to find small effects on behavioral outcomes, and CIs mostly focus around small or very small effect sizes, with a few exceptions.</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt12" id="ftnt_ref12">[12]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;There is very weak evidence of long-term effects from BIs.</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt13" id="ftnt_ref13">[13]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;Meta-analyses found small effects on long-term behavioral outcomes, with CIs ranging from no effect through to small effects. Indirect comparison in two meta-analyses focused on alcohol found that short-term effects were moderately or substantially larger than long-term effects, though the CIs suggest a wide range of possible differences in either direction.</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt14" id="ftnt_ref14">[14]</a></sup></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c0">One review argues that the identified effects were so small that they were unlikely to be cost-effective, though this claim does not seem to hold much weight without a cost-benefit analysis.</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt15" id="ftnt_ref15">[15]</a></sup></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c0">One review found that BIs had significant effects compared to assessment-only controls (i.e. participants only saw assessments after signing up), but insignificant effects compared to information-provision controls (i.e. participants saw basic information on the health issue, but no further advice was given), which weakly suggests that both information-provision-only and face-to-face BIs may have some effects, though the effects of both may be small or very small.</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt16" id="ftnt_ref16">[16]</a></sup></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c0">There are differences between the BIs evaluated in the health behavior literature and the most comparable interventions currently carried out in the farmed animal movement. For example, health professionals carrying out BIs face-to-face have usually been trained in techniques such as motivational interviewing, and the specific components of BIs for health behavior have been honed through decades of research into SCMs.</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt17" id="ftnt_ref17">[17]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;Additionally, health behavior BIs are usually aligned with the recipient&rsquo;s explicit goals, more so than farmed animal movement audiences, who may see messages like &ldquo;eat less meat&rdquo; as confrontational. Also, BIs are often administered based on the results of individual screening processes. They are therefore often targeted towards only those who need them and sometimes provide tailored information.</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt18" id="ftnt_ref18">[18]</a></sup><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;The effects of these differences on the overall effect size are difficult to predict.</span></p><h2 class="c7" id="h.axyo3lv8557t"><span class="c1 c13">Motivational Interviewing (MI)</span></h2><p class="c10"><span class="c1 c0">Motivational interviewing (MI) is a specific form of counseling that helps individuals explore and resolve their ambivalence towards behavior change. In several reviews, MI is described as a form of BI, although not all BIs involve motivational interviewing, and it is possible for MIs to be repeated over many sessions.

For example, they summarize that &ldquo;Harrington 2016 reported the average cost per quitter at six&#8208;month follow&#8208;up was USD 283 for their web intervention (n = 190) and USD 20 for usual care (n = 198), but noted that the cost of the intervention decreases to USD 57 per quit without programmer costs.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c4 c11"><span class="c1 c2"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1 c2">For the three studies that compared costs directly with the costs of other intervention types, results seem very favorable, given the findings overall from the meta-analysis that internet-based interventions are more effective than non-active controls and similarly effective to active controls, although the reviewers note that only one included trial actually demonstrated cost-effectiveness for its intervention. They note that, &ldquo;Skov&#8208;Ettrup 2016 reported that the cost per user of their Internet intervention &lsquo;e&#8208;quit&rsquo; was GBP 4.30 (n = 225), while the cost of the self&#8208;help booklet was GBP 1.80 (n = 451), and the cost of proactive and reactive telephone counselling was GBP 48 (n = 245) and GBP 39 (n = 30), respectively. Etter 2005 estimated that the total cost of implementing the website, for a reach of 8000 participants in computer&#8208;tailored programmes and for 600,000 visitors a year to the website, is comparable to the cost of running a small smoking cessation clinic which would treat about 50 smokers a month. Rabius 2008 suggested Internet assistance for smoking cessation was cost&#8208;effective, since four days of programming at a cost of less than USD 2000 allowed approximately 5000 additional users for services from the five tailored interactive service providers, compared with the much higher cost of serving 1000 new clients with telephone counselling (approximately USD 100,000).&rdquo;</span></p></div><div><p class="c4"><a href="#ftnt_ref101" id="ftnt101">[101]</a><span class="c2">&nbsp;Heleen Riper, Matthijs Blankers, Hana Hadiwijaya, John Cunningham, Stella Clarke, Reinout Wiers, David Ebert, and Pim Cuijpers, &ldquo;Effectiveness of Guided and Unguided Low-Intensity Internet Interventions for Adult Alcohol Misuse: A Meta-Analysis,&rdquo; </span><span class="c2 c8">PLoS ONE </span><span class="c1 c2">(June 2014) notes that, &ldquo;[s]tudies on web-based self-help interventions for adult problem drinking show that (1) the interventions are mostly of an unguided nature and are delivered as stand-alone procedures directly to participants in the community, and to a far lesser extent via primary care, clinical or employment settings; (2) they largely reach first-time help seekers (with rates varying from 80% to 90%); (3) people who misuse alcohol take up these services on a much wider scale than the available brief, low-intensity face-to-face interventions in primary care settings; and (4) people differ in whether they desire additional help from professionals.

This therefore does not account for a potential a backfire effect amongst recipients, who view the materials as an unwanted challenge to their behavior or beliefs and slightly increase the amount of cigarettes that they smoke. The authors note that &ldquo;studies in this review tended to include participants regardless of whether or not they wanted to quit smoking (only three of the 20 studies in our primary analyses focused on smokers who wished to stop.&rdquo; However, 11 of the 20 studies of non-tailored materials involved participants who &ldquo;responded to promotion of smoking cessation programmes or volunteered for a trial.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4 c11"><span class="c1 c2"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Camille E.

This is particularly important in the tailoring area given that many studies are based on a stage of change perspective that suggests that individuals may move slowly through the stages and may cycle and recycle through the stages numerous times before ultimately maintaining a behavior change (Prochaska et al., 1992). Thus, such a model suggests that individuals may need multiple points of contact in which feedback is dynamically tailored to their current stage of change, attitudes, and so forth. Moreover, studies with additional intervention contacts have the opportunity not only to give additional feedback but to give a different type of feedback. Studies with one point of contact typically give individuals normative feedback, or tailored messages based on a comparison of one&rsquo;s responses to those of their peers. Studies with multiple contacts, however, have the opportunity to give individuals so called ipsative feedback, or messages based on a comparison of one&rsquo;s current responses with their responses at the previous intervention time point (Prochaska et al., 1993; Velicer et al., 1993). The current meta-analysis suggests that studies that utilized more intervention contact points, many of which included ipsative feedback, were more effective in stimulating health behavior change than those that did not.&rdquo;</span></p></div><div><p class="c4"><a href="#ftnt_ref178" id="ftnt178">[178]</a><span class="c2">&nbsp;Jamie Hartmann&#8208;Boyce, Tim Lancaster, and Lindsay F.

In addition, some support was found for possible negative effects of threatening health information on persuasion if perceived efficacy is low (d = &minus;0.31; 95% CI = &minus;0.63 to 0.01, p = .07) [note that this result was not quite statistically significant]. That is, when acknowledging the threat, but feeling helpless what to do, people might engage in defensive action including more intensive continuation of the health risk behavior (cf. Goldenberg &amp; Arndt, 2008). See also Melanie B. Tannenbaum, Justin Hepler, Rick S.

The 95% CIs indicated that fear appeals that were only high in depicted severity had positive effects for attitudes (95% CI: [0.06, 0.37]) and intentions (95% CI: [0.20, 0.39]) but not behaviors (95% CI: [&minus;0.08, 0.42]).... Although this hypothesis was not supported, our results partially replicated a previous meta-analytic finding in which high depicted severity influenced all three outcome measures (de Hoog et al., 2007). The second hypothesis is that fear appeals high in depicted susceptibility (but not severity) will positively influence intentions and behaviors but will not influence attitudes. The 95% CIs indicated that fear appeals that were only high in depicted susceptibility had positive effects for intentions (95% CI: [0.15, 0.59]) and behaviors (95% CI: [0.01, 0.88]) but not attitudes (95% CI: [&minus;0.51, 1.47]). Therefore, this hypothesis was supported. The third hypothesis is that fear appeals with high depicted severity and high depicted susceptibility will positively influence attitudes, intentions, and behaviors. The 95% CIs confirmed this prediction and indicated that fear appeals high on both moderators had positive effects for attitudes (95% CI: [0.05, 0.38]), intentions (95% CI: [0.23, 0.47]), and behaviors (95% CI: [0.24, 0.63]). Further, the 95% CI for the focal outcome in our meta-analysis (the average of attitude, intention, and behavior outcomes) also supported this result: [0.28, 0.50]. Thus, when testing all three hypotheses, fear appeals generally had positive effects on attitudes, intentions, and behaviors when they were high in depicted severity and/or susceptibility.&rdquo;</span></li></ul></div><div><p class="c4"><a href="#ftnt_ref212" id="ftnt212">[212]</a><span class="c2">&nbsp;See, for example, Robert Hornik, Lela Jacobsohn, Robert Orwin, Andrea Piesse, and Graham Kalton, &ldquo;Effects of the National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign on Youths,&rdquo; </span><span class="c2 c8">American Journal of Public Health </span><span class="c1 c2">98, no. 12 (December 2008), 2229-36.</span></p></div><div><p class="c4"><a href="#ftnt_ref213" id="ftnt213">[213]</a><span class="c2">&nbsp;Robert A.

However, these reviews have assessed effects over time, without explicitly focusing on or systematically analysing impacts after incentive removal. This distinction is important since in some studies payment of the final incentive has coincided with the final follow-up assessment (Donatelle et al., 2000a, Donatelle et al., 2000b, Gallagher et al., 2007, Jeffery et al., 1990, Klesges et al., 1987, Rand et al., 1989)... Some evidence suggests that under the right conditions financial incentives could lead to sustained changes (Cahill and Perera, 2011, Troxel and Volpp, 2012, Volpp et al., 2009), highlighting the need for research to move beyond the question of whether incentives work, to elucidate the circumstances under which they are most effective in achieving and sustaining changes (Marteau et al., 2009).&rdquo;</span></p></div><div><p class="c4"><a href="#ftnt_ref272" id="ftnt272">[272]</a><span class="c2">&nbsp;See the spreadsheet &ldquo;</span><span class="c12 c2"><a class="c5" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17Q3QGrhopvbU10xhWwne1kHf7oDCF6xoBbmBloOiNPY/edit?usp%3Dsharing">Strength of Evidence Assessments</a></span><span class="c1 c2">.&rdquo;</span></p></div><div><p class="c4"><a href="#ftnt_ref273" id="ftnt273">[273]</a><span class="c2">&nbsp;See the spreadsheet &ldquo;</span><span class="c12 c2"><a class="c5" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_id9mYamWCRdRHJ7fwNTzPKTBXOuyxMIioVKqUWjiR8/edit?usp%3Dsharing">Effect Size Estimates</a></span><span class="c1 c2">.&rdquo;</span></p></div><div><p class="c4"><a href="#ftnt_ref274" id="ftnt274">[274]</a><span class="c2">&nbsp;Jason D.

Additional studies such as those conducted in England and Taiwan found no evidence of a reduction in cigarette consumption.&rdquo; Given the lack of control groups, it seems plausible that confounding variables such as increased public discussion help to explain these results, although given a mean follow-up interval of 12.11 months, it also seems possible that short-term effects from increased public discussion would have died out.</span></p><p class="c4 c11"><span class="c1 c2"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">&nbsp;Noel T.

Mosbaek and colleagues examined a range of different adverts aired on television and on radio and found the 10 most cost effective adverts were aired on television, while the most cost effective radio advert was ranked 11th overall.

Although this study indicates radio messages can be effective, it was broadcast concurrently with a televised version of the campaign, and so part of its effectiveness may be due to smokers bringing to mind the images associated with the televised advert. Future research should examine the effects of a standalone radio campaign. Despite radio&#39;s lower costs its reduced population reach means that it is unlikely to be a good substitute for television in influencing population-wide smoking, and could be considered a reinforcing adjunct.&rdquo;</span></p></div><div><p class="c4"><a href="#ftnt_ref329" id="ftnt329">[329]</a><span class="c2">&nbsp;Dana Rogers, &ldquo;The Impact of Mass Media-Delivered Family Planning Campaigns in Developing Countries- A Meta-analysis&rdquo; (2018), </span><span class="c12 c2"><a class="c5" href="http://works.bepress.com/dana-rogers/1/">http://works.bepress.com/dana-rogers/1/</a></span><span class="c1 c2">, 52 notes that, &ldquo;[c]ampaigns that included television either on its own or in combination with other media vehicles (k = 21), were positively related to campaign effects, &#x1d6fd; = .088, p = .009.

Intuitively, it seems more likely that a single quitting day would bring forwards quit attempts that smokers were otherwise intending to make, and so the large difference in estimated cost-effectiveness between the studies of NSD and Stoptober seems likely to be exaggerated. Nevertheless, the estimates in this paper suggest that using resources to promote a campaign for a single day may be similarly&mdash;or more&mdash;cost-effective than a month-long pledge campaign.</span></p></div><div><p class="c4"><a href="#ftnt_ref349" id="ftnt349">[349]</a><span class="c2">&nbsp;R.

One recent overview of systematic reviews and an older rapid synthesis found that government monopolies significantly benefit consumption-related harm, however the older rapid synthesis suggests that when a monopoly is not possible, implementing a licensing system for selling alcohol (with the collection of fees) may have similar benefits. One older medium-quality systematic review and a recent rapid synthesis found an association between hours of sale of alcohol and increases in alcohol-related harms, including drinking and driving and road accidents.

Though the heterogeneity in study design made comparison difficult, the limited evidence &ldquo;suggests that the following elements may improve the recruitment of smokers into cessation programmes: personal, tailored interventions; recruitment methods that are proactive in nature; and more intensive recruitment strategies (i.e., those strategies that require increased contact with potential participants).&rdquo; On tailoring, they note that, &ldquo;[w]e identified three studies that made head&#8208;to&#8208;head comparisons of different types of recruitment strategies. Of these, only one study detected a significant effect, finding that a personal phone call was more effective than a generic invitation letter (RR 40.73, 95% CI 2.53 to 654.74). Five studies compared interventions using the same delivery modes but different content. Results showed that tailored messages through an interactive voice response system resulted in a higher recruitment rate than assessment of smoking status alone using the same system (RR 8.64, 95% CI 4.41 to 16.93).&rdquo; This conclusion was in &ldquo;agreement with the conclusion drawn by [an earlier non-Cochrane review] McDonald 1999: interpersonal strategies appear to have a positive effect on the recruitment of participants into smoking cessation programs.&rdquo;</span></p></div></body></html>
