effective animal advocacy (EAA) &mdash; the field of study for how we can most effectively help animals, also known as effective altruism for animals &mdash; there are several important, challenging, and sometimes controversial foundational</span><sup><a href="#ftnt1" id="ftnt_ref1">[1]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;questions that come up over and over. This post attempts to summarize and catalog the key evidence</span><sup><a href="#ftnt2" id="ftnt_ref2">[2]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;cited by EAA supporters on each side of these debates for easy reference. For example, in the &ldquo;Effective Animal Advocacy - Discussion&rdquo; </span><span class="c6"><a class="c10" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/EffectiveAnimalAdvocacy/">Facebook group</a></span><span class="c2">, there have been dozens of threads discussing confrontational strategies like protesting inside a restaurant or grocery store. Repeated arguments include:</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><ul class="c20 lst-kix_xtucc7jvhnny-0 start"><li class="c1 c5"><span class="c2">For confrontation: Confrontation was used successfully by several historical social movements, such as the US gay rights movement. Even though there are differences between movements, this is still useful evidence.</span></li><li class="c1 c5"><span>For nonconfrontation: Confrontation make vegans and animal advocates seem weird and like a fringe demographic, making recruitment more challenging. Many have seen reactions to protests and online videos that suggest this perception is quite common.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt3" id="ftnt_ref3">[3]</a></sup></li></ul><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><h2 class="c24" id="h.p2g5xmw7x82t"><span class="c14">Clarifying notes</span></h2><p class="c1"><span>This post is intended for advocates and researchers wanting to make the most accurate assessments of what strategies have the highest expected impact, even in the face of limited knowledge. The evidence herein will not satisfy any desire for scientific proof. (We discuss this in more detail in </span><span class="c6"><a class="c10" href="https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/blog/speculation-and-intuition-as-evidence">this blog post</a></span><span class="c2">.)</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">This post includes evidence that EAA researchers think is strongest: anecdotes and intuition, speculation, social movement trends, psychology findings, marketing findings, animal advocacy experiments, and any other information that makes one hypothesis more likely to be true than another.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>We attempt to categorize each piece of evidence into the side of the debate that we expect a significant majority of EAA researchers agree it supports.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt4" id="ftnt_ref4">[4]</a></sup><span class="c2">&nbsp;Where there is less agreement, or when the evidence&rsquo;s direction depends largely on other questions in this document, it will be noted as pointing in an &ldquo;unclear direction.&rdquo; We also note when there seems to be significant majority agreement among EAA researchers on which side of the overall debate is most likely correct. Note that this does not mean it&rsquo;s highly likely to be correct, just that it seems most compelling given the current evidence. The three questions with that level of agreement are:</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><ul class="c20 lst-kix_n7blg0fpsipr-0 start"><li class="c1 c5"><span class="c2">Individual vs. institutional interventions and messaging (favoring institutional interventions and messaging)</span></li><li class="c1 c5"><span class="c2">Momentum vs. complacency from welfare reforms (favoring momentum from welfare reforms)</span></li><li class="c1 c5"><span>Animal protection vs. environmental vs. human health focus (favoring animal protection focus)</span><sup><a href="#ftnt5" id="ftnt_ref5">[5]</a></sup></li></ul><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Advocates can, of course, take a moderate position between the sides of the debates addressed in this document, and the composition of the animal advocacy movement might need some advocates taking different approaches. This document discusses what approach seems most promising on the margin, e.g. with a new $1,000 donation to the movement.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">It&rsquo;s useful to evaluate movement-wide strategy on the margin, but individual advocates should keep in mind that contexts (e.g. country, time period, resources) vary significantly and are often a crucial factor in individual situations. For example, if you are an established climate activist who now wants to focus on helping animals, you might want to focus more on environmental arguments than the average advocate does because that is where your expertise is and you might have disproportionate influence on environmentalist audiences.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">This document is intended as a living reference, where ideas for further research are logged, new evidence can be added, and additional important questions can be discussed. We will try to update it as frequently as possible.

In comparison, Catholic preaching and local organizing suggest that the early anti-abortion movement had more of a focus on mass influence, though many early advocates were also professionals. The extent to which this difference made abortion reform more likely or more successful is uncertain. Nevertheless, given that abortion was decriminalized up to the point of twelve weeks of pregnancy by Roe v. Wade and that this reform, as well as public opinion on the matter, have not substantially changed since then, this provides weak evidence that social change is more likely to be successful if it is advocated for by professionals first. Additionally, the campaign for abortion reform in Hawaii in 1967-70 culminated in victory for the abortion rights movement; the abortion rights advocates seem to have been more focused on elite influencers than on the public, in contrast to the anti-abortion movement there. These findings provide only very weak evidence for the claim that advocacy for specific issues, such as for particular changes to the manner in which food production is regulated in a country, will be more likely to succeed if professionals advocate for the change first.

Taken together, this research suggests that though social movement or legislative backlash may sometimes occur and may be substantial, this only infrequently results in direct reversals of Supreme Court rulings. The reviewed literature also provides evidence that unanimous Supreme Court rulings and higher pre-decision public opinion decrease the likelihood or size of backlash, but that the number of amicus briefs submitted during a case and higher public awareness of the decision itself have the opposite effect. There is some historical evidence that just as a Supreme Court ruling that supports a social movement&rsquo;s goals may encourage mobilization by the movement&rsquo;s opponents, a Supreme Court ruling that challenges a movement&rsquo;s goals may galvanize the movement into action.

There is now an increased acceptance of the importance of various contingent factors such as the success or failure of the assassination of Franz Ferdinand and the negotiations in July 1914. Although I have not read the primary evidence myself and so do not hold confident views, it seems plausible that changes in these contingent factors would have prevented war. Historians seem to accept the importance of a variety of causes of the French Revolution. From my understanding of the evidence, it seems that while the occurrence of some sort of radical social change in France in the 18th and 19th centuries wasn&rsquo;t as dependent on contingency as the outbreak of World War I, the precise path and outcomes of the Revolution were. From an effective altruism perspective, the precise path might not be very important, but it is possible that this could have dramatically altered the outcomes of the Revolution. It seems unlikely that the development of the industrial revolution depended much on contingency given the long-term forces at play, although other forms of trajectory change may still have been tractable. In several of the included historical case studies, notably with the rise of US environmentalism in the 1960s, the apparent influence of certain intellectuals suggests that their ideas might be more important than luck or subsequent decision-making processes in shaping broad developments.&rdquo; - Jamie Harris, </span><span class="c0"><a class="c10" href="https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/blog/how-tractable-is-changing-the-course-of-history">How tractable is changing the course of history?</a></span></p></div><div><p class="c8"><a href="#ftnt_ref224" id="ftnt224">[224]</a><span class="c15 c7">&nbsp;&ldquo;For all except one intervention type considered in this report, where evidence was available, meta-analyses suggest that effect sizes are smaller when measured at longer follow-up.

Empirical studies by social movement sociologists show that social movements and individual organizations have succeeded in having an impact but that this is difficult and usually only achieved with the support of public opinion and/or allies in the political system. Comparative historical sociologists note the importance of broad contextual factors in shaping historical outcomes, but accepting their arguments doesn&rsquo;t limit tractability much&hellip; Through researching and writing this post, I have updated towards contingency playing a greater role in determining historical outcomes than I initially hypothesized, most notably as a result of the historical case studies considered here. Considering the broad implications of chaos theory also led me to update slightly towards the importance of contingency. Given that chaos theory has been used to improve prediction accuracy for issues such as weather systems, it seems that it has some real-world applicability, the implications of which contrast with my previous intuitions about causation.

Although I still see a variety of indirect factors as encouraging MCE, I no longer see this as being so important in reducing tractability. I have not come across any good evidence that the trajectory towards moral circle expansion would be any more or less determined by contingency than other historical social trends, except for the possibility that the breadth of moral circles might end up being significantly determined by the values and decisions of a small number of individuals with influence over the nature of important technologies like superintelligence (such as AI researchers, policy makers, company executives, or thought leaders), which might actually increase tractability, since MCE within a smaller group of people could be less difficult to achieve than MCE in society as a whole.&rdquo; - Jamie Harris, </span><span class="c0"><a class="c10" href="https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/blog/how-tractable-is-changing-the-course-of-history">How tractable is changing the course of history?</a></span></p></div><div><p class="c8"><a href="#ftnt_ref227" id="ftnt227">[227]</a><span class="c15 c7">&nbsp;See the evaluations by Rethink Priorities, Founders Pledge, and Animal Charity Evaluators,</span></p></div><div><p class="c8"><a href="#ftnt_ref228" id="ftnt228">[228]</a><span class="c7">&nbsp;&ldquo;Benjamin F.

Someone disagreed with me because her intuition was that it is easier to change attitudes than to raise salience. I.e., once people are talking about the issue, it is easy to implement solutions.

That being said, if there were compelling evidence that specifically should pull one&#39;s probability distribution to the center (e.g. a high sample size survey with a null result), it could be worth making a special category for readability.

However, given the findings of significant effects in some circumstances and the unexplained heterogeneity in Akl et al.&rsquo;s Cochrane review, I am moderately confident that significant differences between framing effects are possible in certain contexts.&quot;</span></p></div><div class="c3"><p class="c11"><a href="#cmnt_ref73" id="cmnt73">[bu]</a><span class="c2">Definitions, if needed:</span></p><p class="c11 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c2">Gain-framed messages emphasize the positive consequences of compliance with an advocated view or behavior, such as &ldquo;if you stop eating meat, you are likely to live longer.&rdquo; Loss-framed messages emphasize the negative consequences of non-compliance, such as &ldquo;eating meat decreases your expected life span.&rdquo; Some reviews also distinguish the gain-framed versus loss-framed dichotomy from differences in attribute framing; &ldquo;Attribute framing is the positive versus negative description of a specific attribute of a single item or a state, for example, &lsquo;the chance of survival with cancer is 2/3&#39; versus &lsquo;the chance of mortality with cancer is 1/3.&rsquo;&rdquo; I include evaluations of both these framing variations here.</span></p></div><div class="c3"><p class="c11"><a href="#cmnt_ref74" id="cmnt74">[bv]</a><span class="c2">I don&#39;t think the definitions are needed.
