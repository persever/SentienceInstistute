Some of the studies (7/33) built on multicomponent and multilevel interventions such as intervention mapping (IM), socioecological theories or models, and models for individual behaviour; for example, theory of planned behaviour (TPB), social cognitive learning theory (SCT), and health belief model (HBM). Especially in the whole of community and school-based interventions, the background and theoretical frameworks were linked to theories of empowerment, participation, and whole-school participatory tailored approaches (5/33). Across the studies, there existed &ldquo;a light way&rdquo; of using theory. Theoretical framework was more often simply referred to, rather than something that was used concretely in problem formulation and as a basic structure in the studies.&rdquo; The authors therefore conclude that, &ldquo;[t]here is a need to prioritise interventions that include study designs of high quality [and] the use of theoretical constructs to guide the studies.&rdquo;</span></p></div><div><p class="c6"><a href="#ftnt_ref31" id="ftnt31">[31]</a><span class="c3 c1">&nbsp;Ryan E.

Among the adult literature, the theories applied most for this evaluation were Bandura&rsquo;s (1998) social cognitive theory (88% of reviews) and Prochaska and DiClemente&rsquo;s (1982) Transtheoretical Model (82% of reviews), followed by Ajzen&rsquo;s (1991) theory of planned behaviour (29% of reviews). No difference in the application of theory on PA outcomes was reported in 76% of reviews, while 18% of the reviews drew the conclusion that the presence of a stated theory was associated with more successful interventions. Among young people, the theoretical applications all involved variants of social cognitive theory and 75% of reviews concluded no difference between use of a reported theory or no such reporting. One review showed that interventions not reporting a theory resulted in greater PA than those based on an explicit theory. Overall, the evidence suggests that explicit use of theory does not moderate the effectiveness of interventions among youth or adults, yet the use of theory thus far is limited to the social cognitive tradition.&rdquo;</span></p></div><div><p class="c6"><a href="#ftnt_ref32" id="ftnt32">[32]</a><span class="c1">&nbsp;Desmond McEwan, Mark R.

Given the important theoretical position of self-efficacy cognitions within both social-cognitive theory and the theory of planned behaviour, and the well-defined direct links between self-efficacy and behaviour in multiple domains, our results confirm the importance of fostering cognitions related to personal control over behaviour in influencing both motivation and physical activity behaviour.&rdquo;</span></p></div><div><p class="c6"><a href="#ftnt_ref42" id="ftnt42">[42]</a><span class="c1">&nbsp;Mark Conner and Paul Norman, &ldquo;Predicting and changing health behaviour: a social cognition approach,&rdquo; in Mark Conner and Paul Norman (eds.),</span><span class="c10 c1">&nbsp;Predicting and changing health behaviour: Research and practice with social cognition models</span><span class="c3 c1">&nbsp;(Maidenhead: Open University Press, 2015; first published 1995), 19-20: &ldquo;First, models that have been developed specifically to predict health behaviour (i.e. health action process approach, health belief model, protection motivation theory) focus on the notion of threat as measured by perceived susceptibility/vulnerability and perceived severity&hellip; Second, most social cognition models of health behaviour focus on the perceived consequences of performing a health behaviour&hellip; Third, there is considerable overlap between the perceived behavioural control component of the TPB and self-efficacy&hellip; Fourth, social cognition models of health behaviour do not explicitly cover normative influences on behaviour (Conner and Norman 1994), with the exception of the TPB, which includes the subjective norm construct and underlying normative beliefs, and the PWM, which also includes the prototype construct&hellip; Fifth, nearly all models include an intervening variable that is seen to mediate the relationship between other social cognitive variables and behaviour&hellip; Sixth, the TPB, SCT, and HAPA all postulate a direct relationship between self-efficacy (or perceived behavioural control) and behaviour in addition to the one between intention and behaviour&hellip; Finally, there are a number of similarities in more recent models (e.g. HAPA) that have sought to outline the variables that are important in the volitional phase of health behaviour (e.g. Weinstein 1988; Heckhausen 1991; Bagozzi 1992; Schwarzer 1992; Gollwitzer 1993; Kuhl and Beckmann 1994).

They identified eight variables, which, they argued, should account for most of the variance in any (deliberative) behaviour (Figure 1.1). These were organized into two sets. The first set were those variables that they viewed as necessary and sufficient determinants of behaviour. Thus, for behaviour to occur, an individual must (i) have a strong intention, (ii) have the necessary skills to perform the behaviour, and (iii) experience an absence of environmental constraints that could prevent behaviour. The variables in the second set were primarily seen to influence intention, though it was noted that some of the variables may also have a direct effect on behaviour. Thus, a strong intention is likely to occur when an individual (iv) perceives the advantages (or benefits) of performing the behaviour to outweigh the perceived disadvantages (or costs), (v) perceives the social (normative) pressure to perform the behaviour to be greater than that not to perform the behaviour, (vi) believes that the behaviour is consistent with his or her self-image, (vii) anticipates the emotional reaction to performing the behaviour to be more positive than negative, and (viii) has high levels of self-efficacy.&rdquo;</span></p></div><div><p class="c6"><a href="#ftnt_ref44" id="ftnt44">[44]</a><span class="c1">&nbsp;Mark Conner and Paul Norman, &ldquo;Predicting and changing health behaviour: a social cognition approach,&rdquo; in Mark Conner and Paul Norman (eds.),</span><span class="c10 c1">&nbsp;Predicting and changing health behaviour: Research and practice with social cognition models</span><span class="c3 c1">&nbsp;(Maidenhead: Open University Press, 2015; first published 1995), 22 criticize Fishbein et al&rsquo;s 2001 combined model: &ldquo;First, it includes a number of constructs that do not feature in the main social cognition models&hellip; Second, it is noteworthy that the integrated model fails to include perceptions of susceptibility and severity, which are key constructs in the health belief model and protection motivation theory&hellip; Third, the model lacks detail regarding the relationships between its constructs. In fact, Fishbein et al. (2001) noted that the major theorists were unable to agree on the likely nature of these relationships&hellip; Fourth, no empirical test of the model has been conducted to date... Finally, the model is fairly mute on the post-intentional (i.e. volitional) phase of health behaviour, simply stating that in addition to a strong intention, an individual must also possess the necessary skills to perform the behaviour and not encounter any environmental constraints that could prevent performance of the behaviour.&rdquo;</span></p></div></body></html>
