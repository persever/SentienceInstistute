<meta name="citation_abstract" content="Social movements often try to affect public opinion as a lever for legislation and other social change. This report provides a broad overview of research relating to (1) whether advocates can successfully influence public opinion and how they can do so most effectively, and (2) what the other causes of public opinion change are and how advocates can harness them. Key findings include that direct persuasion attempts to change attitudes (rather than behavior) tend to have “small” or “very small” short-term effects, but advocates may be able to have lasting indirect effects on public opinion via policy change or reframing the issues. We list factors that affect how persuasive messages are and make tentative suggestions for how advocates can cost-effectively leverage external influences on public opinion such as the media, celebrities, politicians, and policy.">

However, these tactics can reduce message effectiveness or lead to boomerang effects if they are used</span><span>&nbsp;incorrectly</span><span>&nbsp;or </span><span>excessively</span><span class="c5">.</span></li><li class="c14 c22 li-bullet-0"><span>Describing but refuting opposing arguments can increase the effectiveness of persuasive messages and make audiences more </span><span>resistant to opposing persuasion attempts.</span></li><li class="c14 c22 li-bullet-0"><span>Persuasive messages tend to be more effective if the audience is less familiar with or opinionated about an issue.</span><span>&nbsp;This suggests that advocates can influence public opinion towards less salient attributes or sub-topics (e.g. a specific farming practice) if they are able to shape the initial media coverage or share persuasive messages widely. It also suggests that tactics that are aimed at increasing salience may be counterproductive (by making subsequent attitude change more difficult) on issues where public opinion is currently unfavorable.</span></li></ul><ul class="c23 lst-kix_1lt8dp12zbee-0"><li class="c14 c18 li-bullet-0"><span>Framing variations can influence attitudes through different mechanisms to direct persuasion attempts by encouraging audiences to place more weight on some considerations than others.</span></li><li class="c14 c18 li-bullet-0"><span>Protests and social movement events can</span><span>&nbsp;influence </span><span class="c5">public opinion as well as the public&rsquo;s perceptions of the importance of certain issues.</span></li><li class="c14 c18 li-bullet-0"><span>The media can cause public opinion change through persuasive messaging or one-sided coverage. Additionally, if it highlights certain attributes of an issue over others, the media can influence overall public opinion </span><span>without persuasion, similarly to how advocates can influence attitudes through framing manipulations.</span><span>&nbsp;If advocates can focus media attention on more favorable attributes of an issue, they may be able to indirectly influence public opinion.</span></li><li class="c14 c18 li-bullet-0"><span>High media coverage tends to make the public think that an issue is more </span><span>important</span><span>.</span></li><li class="c14 c18 li-bullet-0"><span>Politicians and celebrities can act as advocates, influencing the attitudes of their audience, though they are not always more persuasive than alternative spokespeople. They can also influence media coverage and public perceptions of the importance of certain topics or attributes. </span><span>This suggests that if advocates can encourage supportive public comments from these individuals, this could be worthwhile, but efforts would be counterproductive if they encouraged hostile comments.</span></li><li class="c14 c18 li-bullet-0"><span>If advocates can secure policy change, public opinion will tend to move towards support for those policies.</span></li><li class="c14 c18 li-bullet-0"><span>Intergroup contact</span><span>&nbsp;and several other prejudice reduction strategies can encourage moral consideration of outgroups</span><span>, though it may be difficult for advocates to cost-effectively utilize these strategies on a large </span><span>scale</span><span class="c5">.</span></li><li class="c14 c18 li-bullet-0"><span>The effects on attitudes from exposure to single messages &mdash; whether from persuasive messaging, framing manipulations, or media coverage &mdash; are most pronounced immediately after exposure to the message. The effects diminish with time, though at least some effects have been found weeks afterwards.</span><span>&nbsp;For advocates to cost-effectively cause </span><span>l</span><span>asting</span><span>&nbsp;public opinion change, they therefore probably need to encourage some sort of self-perpetuating mechanism such as new legislation, social norms, or framings used by the media.</span></li><li class="c14 c18 li-bullet-0"><span>A number of indirect or long-term factors can influence public opinion, such as demographic changes and major events beyond the control of advocates.</span></li></ul><h1 class="c34" id="h.hbj56v8qwfnu"><span class="c37">Methodology</span></h1><p class="c14"><span>Search terms</span><span>&nbsp;were inputted into Google Scholar, seeking to identify meta-analyses, textbooks, and summary articles relevant to the causes of public opinion change, especially those that might be relevant for advocacy strategy.

More recently, a model of powerful effects under limiting conditions has gained more adherents. It denies the early all-powerful view of the media, but stresses that they have important effects in particular circumstances and with particular individuals.

Furthermore, current conceptions include a wide range of media effects&mdash;not just changing attitudes, but also forming new attitudes, beliefs, or behaviors, reinforcing already existing ones, and crystallizing previously vague or unstated beliefs or attitudes.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt139" id="ftnt_ref139">[139]</a></sup></p><p class="c9"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c14"><span>They summarize that there is evidence that, &ldquo;mass communication usually serves to reinforce existing attitudes and opinions&rdquo; and &ldquo;[w]hen mass communication does produce attitude change, minor change in the extremity or intensity of the attitude is much more common than is &lsquo;conversion&rsquo; from one side of an issue to the other side.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt140" id="ftnt_ref140">[140]</a></sup></p><p class="c9"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c14"><span>This does not preclude the possibility that advocates could encourage substantial public opinion changes in usual circumstances, such as if they manage to encourage sustained shifts in the overall tone of media coverage.

(1987) concluded that when interest groups push in one direction, public opinion more often than not moves in the other. A study of the effect of interest group campaigning on five ballot initiatives in California also came to the conclusion that interest groups can find it difficult to positively shape public opinion (Lupia 1994). In an experimental study, Nicholson (2011) found that support for a fictitious ballot proposal was the same when it was sponsored by the tobacco industry and when it was sponsored by a public health advocacy group. McEntire et al. (2015), finally, show how different types of frames that human rights organisations use matter for citizens&rsquo; attitudes towards human rights abuses. Several case studies also assessed the impact of specific interest group campaigns on public opinion (Burstein 1985; Wlezien &amp; Goggin 1993; Andsager 2000; McKnight &amp; Hobbs 2013; D&uuml;r &amp; Mateo 2014). While some of them find little evidence of an impact of these campaigns (e.g., Andsager 2000), others offer evidence of interest groups&rsquo; ability to push public opinion in the desired direction (McKnight &amp; Hobbs 2013; D&uuml;r &amp; Mateo 2014). A few studies also look at the impact of interest group endorsements on support for specific political candidates (Arceneaux &amp; Kolodny 2009; Weber et al. 2012; Neddenriep &amp; Nownes 2014). Most of them find that interest groups can influence vote choices.&rdquo; D&uuml;r conducts two experiments, providing a persuasive argument attributed to either interest groups or some other entity, and finds that these arguments can significantly affect opinion but that the source cue makes little difference.</span></p><p class="c6 c21"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">Andreas Jungherr et al., &ldquo;A Source Like Any Other?

Our intervention delivers one additional ad in the heart of a marked presidential campaign that aired hundreds of thousands of such advertisements. This promotes external validity, but we are measuring the marginal effect of one additional advertisement. We do not measure the impact of an entire advertising campaign. If effectiveness were to increase linearly in advertisements viewed (or if the marginal returns diminished slowly enough), then these small effects could be highly consequential, consistent with the observed level of spending by candidates on advertising. Our data cannot speak to this question of scale, although the result in Table 1 that effects do not vary by battleground status (where people see many more advertisements than those who live in non-battleground states) suggests that marginal effectiveness may not depend on ambient levels of advertising.&rdquo;</span></p></div><div><p class="c6"><a href="#ftnt_ref21" id="ftnt21">[21]</a><span class="c4">&nbsp;Jamie Harris, Jacy Reese Anthis, and Kelly Anthis, &ldquo;Health Behavior Interventions Literature Review,&rdquo; July 24, 2020,</span><span class="c4"><a class="c0" href="https://sentienceinstitute.org/health-behavior">&nbsp;</a></span><span class="c1 c4"><a class="c0" href="https://sentienceinstitute.org/health-behavior">https://sentienceinstitute.org/health-behavior</a></span><span class="c4">.

By comparing the precinct with its direct surroundings, the study shows that the revote campaign had long-lasting effects on vote choice and broader security-sensitive behavior. Residents in the revote precinct installed more warning signs on their property to deter burglars. They were not more supportive of right-wing attitudes but were more likely to believe that election fraud reoccurred.&rdquo;</span></p></div><div><p class="c6"><a href="#ftnt_ref106" id="ftnt106">[106]</a><span class="c4">&nbsp;Karin Braunsberger, &ldquo;The Impact of Animal Welfare Advertising on Opposition to the Canadian Seal Hunt and Willingness to Boycott the Canadian Seafood Industry,&rdquo; </span><span class="c2">Anthrozo&ouml;s</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;27, no. 1 (March 1, 2014): 111&ndash;25,</span><span class="c4"><a class="c0" href="https://doi.org/10.2752/175303714X13837396326530">&nbsp;</a></span><span class="c1 c4"><a class="c0" href="https://doi.org/10.2752/175303714X13837396326530">https://doi.org/10.2752/175303714X13837396326530</a></span><span class="c3">.</span></p></div><div><p class="c6"><a href="#ftnt_ref107" id="ftnt107">[107]</a><span class="c4">&nbsp;Elizabeth Levy Paluck et al., &ldquo;Prejudice Reduction: Progress and Challenges,&rdquo; </span><span class="c2">Annual Review of Psychology</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;72, no. 1 (January 4, 2021): 533&ndash;60,</span><span class="c4"><a class="c0" href="https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-psych-071620-030619">&nbsp;</a></span><span class="c1 c4"><a class="c0" href="https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-psych-071620-030619">https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-psych-071620-030619</a></span><span class="c4">.</span></p></div><div><p class="c6"><a href="#ftnt_ref108" id="ftnt108">[108]</a><span class="c4">&nbsp;Elizabeth Levy Paluck et al., &ldquo;Prejudice Reduction: Progress and Challenges,&rdquo; </span><span class="c2">Annual Review of Psychology</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;72, no. 1 (January 4, 2021): 533&ndash;60,</span><span class="c4"><a class="c0" href="https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-psych-071620-030619">&nbsp;</a></span><span class="c1 c4"><a class="c0" href="https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-psych-071620-030619">https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-psych-071620-030619</a></span><span class="c4">.</span></p></div><div><p class="c6"><a href="#ftnt_ref109" id="ftnt109">[109]</a><span class="c4">&nbsp;Elizabeth Levy Paluck et al., &ldquo;Prejudice Reduction: Progress and Challenges,&rdquo; </span><span class="c2">Annual Review of Psychology</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;72, no. 1 (January 4, 2021): 533&ndash;60,</span><span class="c4"><a class="c0" href="https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-psych-071620-030619">&nbsp;</a></span><span class="c1 c4"><a class="c0" href="https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-psych-071620-030619">https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-psych-071620-030619</a></span><span class="c3">.

Analogous findings of minor shifts in the area of political attitudes started with the pioneering study of Lazarsfeld et al. (1948). Similarly, a large-scale panel study of television&#39;s influence in British elections showed again that attitude changes of most voters were either small or absent altogether. Only about 10% of voters changed their intended vote from one party to another during the campaign (Blumler &amp; McQuail, 1969). Even such a major political upheaval as the Watergate scandal, with its massive media coverage, caused relatively small changes in political attitudes among the American public (Robinson, 1974).&rdquo; On pages 324-5 they likewise summarize that, &ldquo;[m]ost studies of electioneering propaganda have shown relatively little resulting attitude change&mdash;often no change at all. However&hellip; In many cases the most important effect of political persuasion may be reinforcement&mdash;that is, strengthening people&#39;s already existing attitudes,&rdquo; especially given that people often self-select which messages to listen to.

The consequence, if government is adaptive in this sense, is that no policy preference will ever trend permanently in one direction.&rdquo; Stimson argues in chapters 2 and 3 that these changes are mostly related to the Republican-Democratic Party splits on these issues.</span></p></div><div><p class="c6"><a href="#ftnt_ref188" id="ftnt188">[188]</a><span class="c4">&nbsp;For some discussion of how such factors affect the tractability of change (not focused on public opinion per se), see Jamie Harris and Jacy Reese Anthis, &ldquo;How Tractable Is Changing the Course of History?,&rdquo; </span><span class="c2">Sentience Institute </span><span class="c4">(blog)</span><span class="c4">, April 12, 2019,</span><span class="c4"><a class="c0" href="http://www.sentienceinstitute.org/blog/how-tractable-is-changing-the-course-of-history">&nbsp;</a></span><span class="c1 c4"><a class="c0" href="http://www.sentienceinstitute.org/blog/how-tractable-is-changing-the-course-of-history">http://www.sentienceinstitute.org/blog/how-tractable-is-changing-the-course-of-history</a></span><span class="c3">.</span></p></div><div><p class="c6"><a href="#ftnt_ref189" id="ftnt189">[189]</a><span class="c4">&nbsp;Stuart Oskamp and P.
