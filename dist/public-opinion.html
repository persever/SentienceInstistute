<meta name="citation_abstract" content="Social movements often try to affect public opinion as a lever for legislation and other social change. This report provides a broad overview of research relating to (1) whether advocates can successfully influence public opinion and how they can do so most effectively, and (2) what the other causes of public opinion change are and how advocates can harness them. Key findings include that direct persuasion attempts to change attitudes (rather than behavior) tend to have “small” or “very small” short-term effects, but advocates may be able to have lasting indirect effects on public opinion via policy change or reframing the issues. We list factors that affect how persuasive messages are and make tentative suggestions for how advocates can cost-effectively leverage external influences on public opinion such as the media, celebrities, politicians, and policy.">

However, these tactics can reduce message effectiveness or lead to boomerang effects if they are used</span><span>&nbsp;incorrectly</span><span>&nbsp;or </span><span>excessively</span><span class="c5">.</span></li><li class="c14 c22 li-bullet-0"><span>Describing but refuting opposing arguments can increase the effectiveness of persuasive messages and make audiences more </span><span>resistant to opposing persuasion attempts.</span></li><li class="c14 c22 li-bullet-0"><span>Persuasive messages tend to be more effective if the audience is less familiar with or opinionated about an issue.</span><span>&nbsp;This suggests that advocates can influence public opinion towards less salient attributes or sub-topics (e.g. a specific farming practice) if they are able to shape the initial media coverage or share persuasive messages widely. It also suggests that tactics that are aimed at increasing salience may be counterproductive (by making subsequent attitude change more difficult) on issues where public opinion is currently unfavorable.</span></li></ul><ul class="c23 lst-kix_1lt8dp12zbee-0"><li class="c14 c18 li-bullet-0"><span>Framing variations can influence attitudes through different mechanisms to direct persuasion attempts by encouraging audiences to place more weight on some considerations than others.</span></li><li class="c14 c18 li-bullet-0"><span>Protests and social movement events can</span><span>&nbsp;influence </span><span class="c5">public opinion as well as the public&rsquo;s perceptions of the importance of certain issues.</span></li><li class="c14 c18 li-bullet-0"><span>The media can cause public opinion change through persuasive messaging or one-sided coverage. Additionally, if it highlights certain attributes of an issue over others, the media can influence overall public opinion </span><span>without persuasion, similarly to how advocates can influence attitudes through framing manipulations.</span><span>&nbsp;If advocates can focus media attention on more favorable attributes of an issue, they may be able to indirectly influence public opinion.</span></li><li class="c14 c18 li-bullet-0"><span>High media coverage tends to make the public think that an issue is more </span><span>important</span><span>.</span></li><li class="c14 c18 li-bullet-0"><span>Politicians and celebrities can act as advocates, influencing the attitudes of their audience, though they are not always more persuasive than alternative spokespeople. They can also influence media coverage and public perceptions of the importance of certain topics or attributes. </span><span>This suggests that if advocates can encourage supportive public comments from these individuals, this could be worthwhile, but efforts would be counterproductive if they encouraged hostile comments.</span></li><li class="c14 c18 li-bullet-0"><span>If advocates can secure policy change, public opinion will tend to move towards support for those policies.</span></li><li class="c14 c18 li-bullet-0"><span>Intergroup contact</span><span>&nbsp;and several other prejudice reduction strategies can encourage moral consideration of outgroups</span><span>, though it may be difficult for advocates to cost-effectively utilize these strategies on a large </span><span>scale</span><span class="c5">.</span></li><li class="c14 c18 li-bullet-0"><span>The effects on attitudes from exposure to single messages &mdash; whether from persuasive messaging, framing manipulations, or media coverage &mdash; are most pronounced immediately after exposure to the message. The effects diminish with time, though at least some effects have been found weeks afterwards.</span><span>&nbsp;For advocates to cost-effectively cause </span><span>l</span><span>asting</span><span>&nbsp;public opinion change, they therefore probably need to encourage some sort of self-perpetuating mechanism such as new legislation, social norms, or framings used by the media.</span></li><li class="c14 c18 li-bullet-0"><span>A number of indirect or long-term factors can influence public opinion, such as demographic changes and major events beyond the control of advocates.</span></li></ul><h1 class="c34" id="h.hbj56v8qwfnu"><span class="c37">Methodology</span></h1><p class="c14"><span>Search terms</span><span>&nbsp;were inputted into Google Scholar, seeking to identify meta-analyses, textbooks, and summary articles relevant to the causes of public opinion change, especially those that might be relevant for advocacy strategy.

More recently, a model of powerful effects under limiting conditions has gained more adherents. It denies the early all-powerful view of the media, but stresses that they have important effects in particular circumstances and with particular individuals. Thus current research is apt to focus on the interacting variables and contingent conditions under which media effects will emerge most clearly&mdash;for instance, under conditions of heavy viewing and weak prior predispositions. Furthermore, current conceptions include a wide range of media effects&mdash;not just changing attitudes, but also forming new attitudes, beliefs, or behaviors, reinforcing already existing ones, and crystallizing previously vague or unstated beliefs or attitudes.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt139" id="ftnt_ref139">[139]</a></sup></p><p class="c9"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c14"><span>They summarize that there is evidence that, &ldquo;mass communication usually serves to reinforce existing attitudes and opinions&rdquo; and &ldquo;[w]hen mass communication does produce attitude change, minor change in the extremity or intensity of the attitude is much more common than is &lsquo;conversion&rsquo; from one side of an issue to the other side.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt140" id="ftnt_ref140">[140]</a></sup></p><p class="c9"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c14"><span>This does not preclude the possibility that advocates could encourage substantial public opinion changes in usual circumstances, such as if they manage to encourage sustained shifts in the overall tone of media coverage.

As a contrasting example, after the Chinese army&#39;s massacre of student protesters in Tiananmen Square in 1989, the percentage of Americans who expressed favorable opinions of China plunged briefly from 72% to 31%. However, even the most dramatic changes in political alignments usually involve attitude changes by only 20% to 30% of the population, and such changes almost always involve a combination of spectacular events and cumulative events.
