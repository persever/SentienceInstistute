Our main topic of interest is expanding humanity&rsquo;s moral circle, particularly the issue of </span><span class="c0"><a class="c7" href="https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/perspective">animal agriculture</a></span><span class="c1 c3">. We are a 501(c)3 tax-deductible nonprofit organization and produce this research with our full-time staff and through collaboration with other researchers.</span></p><p class="c8 c11"><span class="c1 c3"></span></p><p class="c8"><span>In practice, this means we design, implement, and publish research studies that may yield important insights on these topics. For example, we conduct a </span><span class="c0"><a class="c7" href="https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/animal-farming-attitudes-survey-2017">biennial poll</a></span><span>&nbsp;tracking how US residents view animal agriculture and animal-free food technology. You can read through other examples of our work in our </span><span class="c0"><a class="c7" href="https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/research">research reports</a></span><span>&nbsp;or </span><span class="c0"><a class="c7" href="https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/blog/">blog</a></span><span>.</span></p><h2 class="c6" id="h.eoh69krw13w7"><span class="c14 c3">What should I read first?</span></h2><p class="c8"><span>If you would like a broad overview of &ldquo;effective animal advocacy&rdquo; (EAA) research, w</span><span>e </span><span>recommend that you first read our </span><span class="c0"><a class="c7" href="https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/foundational-questions-summaries">Summary of Evidence for Foundational Questions in Effective Animal Advocacy</a></span><span>, which contains summaries of and links to research across the EAA field and elsewhere.</span></p><p class="c8 c11"><span class="c1 c3"></span></p><p class="c8"><span>If you would like a deep dive into a more specific topic, consider our </span><span class="c0"><a class="c7" href="https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/biofuels">biofuels report</a></span><span class="c1 c3">, which outlines the history of four biofuel startup companies and what we can learn about the strategy of developing and commercializing a new technology. This is similar to other case studies we publish on emerging technologies and social movements.</span></p><h2 class="c6" id="h.c4fz4o1qvgxn"><span>What exactly is the moral circle?</span></h2><p class="c8"><span>The moral circle is the set of beings given moral consideration, such as protection in a society&rsquo;s laws. For example, our </span><span class="c0"><a class="c7" href="https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/british-antislavery">report on the British Antislavery Movement</a></span><span>&nbsp;details how slaves in the transatlantic slave trade became included, to an extent, in Britain&rsquo;s moral circle in the early 1800s. The first known use of the &ldquo;circle&rdquo; analogy is William Lecky&rsquo;s </span><span class="c4">History of European Morals from Augustus to Charlemagne</span><span>&nbsp;in 1869. Lecky argued that there has been a &ldquo;natural history&rdquo; of human morals over time towards humanitarianism, benevolence, and the inclusion of more individuals in the &ldquo;circle&rdquo; of &ldquo;benevolent affections.&rdquo; The term was popularized by </span><span class="c0"><a class="c7" href="https://www.utilitarianism.net/utilitarian-thinker/peter-singer">Peter Singer&rsquo;s</a></span><span> </span><span class="c4"> The Expanding Circle</span><span>&nbsp;in </span><span class="c1 c3">1981. Singer argued that factors such as kin selection coupled with rational thinking led to an expanding moral circle.</span></p><p class="c8 c11"><span class="c1 c3"></span></p><p class="c8"><span>By extension, we frequently use the term moral circle expansion (MCE) to refer to increasing the number of beings included in the circle. If humanity&rsquo;s moral circle had expanded sooner and more fully, many historical atrocities may have been prevented, and if advocates are able to expand it today, the future may be much better for all sentient beings.</span><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;Thus, while the moral circle itself is very interesting, we are particularly interested in the factors that lead it to expand, narrow, or stay the same over time.</span></p><h2 class="c6" id="h.t250uikwuf97"><span class="c14 c3">What is effective altruism?</span></h2><p class="c8"><span>Effective altruism (EA) is working out how we can use our time and resources to help others the most. It can be understood as a </span><span class="c0"><a class="c7" href="https://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/ceas-guiding-principles/">set of principles</a></span><span>, a research question (&ldquo;How can we do the most good?&rdquo;), and a </span><span>growing </span><span>community&mdash;though there are many different views on what exactly it means. Core principles of EA can include openness, integrity, and the maintenance of a scientific mindset. This</span><span>&nbsp;implies that we should use research and the best available evidence to inform our decision-making, while accepting that we often need to act on imperfect understandings. </span><span class="c1 c3">Many people who take these ideas into consideration end up focused on issues of animal welfare and rights, and the overlap of the effective altruism and animal advocacy communities is sometimes referred to as &ldquo;effective animal advocacy&rdquo; (EAA). EAA is working out how we can use our time and resources to most effectively encourage positive social change for animals.</span></p><h2 class="c6" id="h.k3zyjx1krhay"><span class="c14 c3">How can we tell what is the most effective way to encourage social change?</span></h2><p class="c8"><span class="c1 c3">The main types of evidence we have available are:</span></p><p class="c8 c11"><span class="c1 c3"></span></p><ul class="c16 lst-kix_m1fnt9t6d46i-0 start"><li class="c8 c15"><span>Analyzing </span><span class="c0"><a class="c7" href="https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/blog/what-can-the-farmed-animal-movement-learn-from-history">the history of social change</a></span><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;(e.g. What tactics did a social movement use and did those tactics succeed? What tactics did proponents of a new technology use to get it popularized?)</span></li><li class="c8 c15"><span>Our </span><span class="c0"><a class="c7" href="https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/blog/speculation-and-intuition-as-evidence">speculation and intuition</a></span><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;(e.g. What percentage of people would you guess go vegetarian after being handed an informational leaflet?)</span></li><li class="c8 c15"><span class="c1 c3">Experiments on social change (e.g. If we take two groups of people and show one information on factory farming, and the other nothing, how do their opinions of vegetarian food differ?)</span></li><li class="c8 c15"><span class="c1 c3">External findings from other topics (e.g. What does the academic psychology literature tell us about how people respond to peer pressure?)</span></li></ul><p class="c8 c11"><span class="c1 c3"></span></p><p class="c8"><span>Each of these has its own </span><span class="c0"><a class="c7" href="https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/foundational-questions-summaries#%5Bmeta%5D-social-movements-vs.-eaa-randomized-controlled-trials-(rcts)-vs.-intuition/speculation/anecdotes-vs.-external-findings">strengths and weaknesses</a></span><span>. For example,</span><span>&nbsp;experiments can isolate a single variable and be specific to the forms of social change that we are most interested in, such as animal advocacy, but they rarely measure how behavior changes over the long run and how people affect each other&rsquo;s behavior in groups, both of which seem crucial for real-world social change. At Sentience Institute, we try to use the methods most appropriate to the specific research question we want to address.</span></p><h2 class="c6" id="h.mtj2z4pdik7s"><span>What is institutional change?</span></h2><p class="c8"><span>Arguably the most important finding of our research has been the effectiveness of </span><span class="c0"><a class="c7" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-020-0405-8">institutional change</a></span><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;and the farmed animal movement&rsquo;s seeming overreliance on individual change. An &ldquo;institution&rdquo; is typically a formal or informal organization, such as a business or government, but can also be less organized social structures, such as the social norms that govern everyday human behavior. For example, institutional changes in government can be triggered by the actions of a small-number of individuals, such as lobbyists or attorneys affecting legislatures or courts, or larger actions, such as mass protests or state-wide voting on ballot initiatives. Governments can regulate farmed animal welfare, endow rights to particular entities, ban whole product categories, increase or decrease taxes and subsidies, or even support the creation of a new market category.</span></p><p class="c8 c11"><span class="c1 c3"></span></p><p class="c8"><span>SI refers to institutional tactics primarily as a contrast to the focus on individual consumption that has been prevalent in the farmed animal movement, changing people&rsquo;s diets (e.g. reducetarian, vegetarian, vegan) one by one, such as through hanging out leaflets or running online ads that compel people to stop eating animal products. </span><span>When </span><span>we </span><span>encourage</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>the farmed animal movement</span><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;to shift towards institutional tactics, we do not mean to imply that there is no need to communicate with the public. For example, a mass media campaign to mobilize the public to vote for a particular ballot initiative would have an institutional focus, even if it would make demands of a large number of individuals, so we would consider this an example of an institutional tactic. In contrast, a mass media campaign asking the public to change their own dietary behavior seems clearly focused on individuals.</span></p><p class="c8 c11"><span class="c1 c3"></span></p><p class="c8"><span>For more information on the &ldquo;institutional approach&rdquo; to animal advocacy and other forms of social change, see our paper at </span><span class="c4">Palgrave Communications</span><span>, </span><span class="c0"><a class="c7" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-020-0405-8">&ldquo;Institutional Change and the Limitations of Consumer Activism.&rdquo;</a></span></p><h2 class="c6" id="h.66185z8w40qd"><span class="c14 c3">How does SI share its research?</span></h2><p class="c8"><span>All of our research is posted to the </span><span class="c0"><a class="c7" href="https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/research">research</a></span><span>&nbsp;or </span><span class="c0"><a class="c7" href="https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/blog/">blog</a></span><span>&nbsp;sections of our website.

Most of our supporters are excited about expanding humanity&rsquo;s moral circle and excited about the value of social change research. Some are individuals, either directly or through institutional mechanisms (e.g. their employer, a </span><span class="c0"><a class="c7" href="https://www.fidelitycharitable.org/guidance/philanthropy/what-is-a-donor-advised-fund.html">donor advised fund</a></span><span class="c1 c3">) and some are organizations, such as private foundations and other nonprofit organizations. Some identify with the effective altruism community, some with the animal advocacy community, and some with both or neither. The vast majority of donations we receive are unrestricted, meaning they are for our general budget and not earmarked for any particular project.</span></p><h2 class="c6" id="h.f2wshvbjhhaa"><span>How does SI think about the long-term future?</span></h2><p class="c8"><span>Alongside many organizations in the effective altruism community, Sentience Institute holds a </span><span class="c4">longtermist</span><span>&nbsp;view, </span><span class="c0"><a class="c7" href="https://globalprioritiesinstitute.org/research-agenda-web-version-2/#_35nkun2">defined</a></span><span>&nbsp;by the Global Priorities Institute as, &ldquo;the view that the primary determinant of the differences in value of the actions we take today is the effect of those actions on the very long-term future.&rdquo; This is because the number of sentient beings that could come into existence in the long-term future is </span><span class="c0"><a class="c7" href="https://www.existential-risk.org/concept.pdf">astronomically large</a></span><span><a class="c7" href="https://www.existential-risk.org/concept.pdf">.

Because our research is highly empirical, most of our time is spent collecting or reviewing relevant data, which we then synthesize into action-relevant insights. As long as your worldview is interested in the sorts of data we focus on, such as historical case studies and surveys, then you can learn from our research. For example, our </span><span class="c0"><a class="c7" href="https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/blog/tech-studies-update">technology adoption case studies</a></span><span>&nbsp;have strategic implications for entrepreneurs seeking to maximize the success of their animal-free food products, and our social movement case studies have strategic implications for activists seeking to reduce the harms of factory farming. This matters whether your timescale is years, decades, centuries, or even longer.</span></p><p class="c8 c11"><span class="c1 c3"></span></p><p class="c8"><span>One sort of person who tends to find our research particularly valuable is someone who cares about the issue of animal farming (or specifically, factory farming), but is more focused on whether we address that </span><span class="c0 c4"><a class="c7" href="https://www.grandchallenges.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/thegrandchallengesapproach.pdf">grand challenge</a></span><span>&nbsp;in the coming decades than on whether we can inspire more people to eat plant-based or pass more cage-free egg policies in the next few years. We have ended up carving out a niche of sorts in this long-term, mixed-method farmed animal advocacy research.</span></p><h2 class="c6" id="h.tfsca4g9ma9f"><span class="c3 c14">You&rsquo;ve mentioned a lot of reports, blog posts, and podcasts, but I like to read books.

For example, if most people would agree with the statement, &ldquo;Humanity&rsquo;s moral circle should expand to include all sentient beings,&rdquo; then is working towards that outcome actually changing anyone&rsquo;s values? It depends, for one, on whether &ldquo;value&rdquo; is solely about terminal goals or also includes factors such as the relative prioritization, e.g. do we spend some of our time and attention on helping animals while there is so much human suffering in the world?</span></p></div><div><p class="c10"><a href="#ftnt_ref2" id="ftnt2">[2]</a><span class="c3 c23">&nbsp;There are several groupings that we might refer to as &ldquo;movements&rdquo; related to SI&rsquo;s work, such as the farmed animal movement, the animal rights movement, the animal welfare movement, the effective animal advocacy movement, the effective altruism movement, the artificial sentience rights movement, or the s-risk movement. Most forms of research and other supportive work probably have diffuse effects across these categories. Most of the time, we refer to one or several of these movements only for brevity, since they are all closely related.</span></p></div></body></html>
