<meta name="citation_abstract" content="This report aims to assess (1) the extent to which the prisoners’ rights movement in the United States from the 1950s onwards can be said to have successfully achieved its goals, (2) what factors caused the various successes and failures of this movement, and (3) what these findings suggest about how modern social movements should strategize. The analysis highlights the farmed animal movement as an illustrative example of the strategic implications for a variety of movements. Key findings of this report include that incremental successes of modest improvements in welfare may distract advocates’ attention from more fundamental political and systemic issues and that social movements based heavily on a strategy of litigation (or perhaps any single strategy) seem to be fragile.">

Other expansionist movements seeking expansion of the moral circle, including the farmed animal movement, can glean some strategic insight from the US prisoners&rsquo; rights movement &mdash; that is, evidence on which advocacy strategies are most effective.</span><sup class="c10"><a href="#ftnt1" id="ftnt_ref1">[1]</a></sup></p><p class="c2 c16"><span class="c7 c6"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>This report examines the US social movements and institutional actors (collectively referred to here as the US prisoners&rsquo; rights movement</span><sup class="c10"><a href="#ftnt2" id="ftnt_ref2">[2]</a></sup><span>) that have sought to improve the rights, protections, and wellbeing of people that have been convicted of crimes and incarcerated. That is, it focuses mostly on prisoners, rather than on pre-trial detention in jails, released prisoners, inequalities in the rates of criminal behavior and conviction, or the causes and consequences of crime. This is because advocacy for this specific group of people, who have been partly or wholly excluded from the moral circle, is of more strategic interest to the farmed animal movement than is advocacy on wider issues of rights, fairness, and justice in society as a whole, both in terms of historical comparability and research tractability. Mass incarceration and the harshness of sentencing procedures are considered briefly, as context for the changes in prisoners&rsquo; rights and welfare, but are not the focus of this report. The US anti-death penalty movement, which can be conceptualized as a sub-movement of the prisoners&rsquo; rights movement, has been analyzed in more depth in a separate case study by Sentience Institute.</span><sup class="c10"><a href="#ftnt3" id="ftnt_ref3">[3]</a></sup></p><p class="c2 c16"><span class="c7 c6"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>In comparison to Sentience Institute&rsquo;s case studies of the British antislavery movement, the US anti-abortion movement, and the US anti-death penalty movement,</span><sup class="c10"><a href="#ftnt4" id="ftnt_ref4">[4]</a></sup><span class="c7 c6">&nbsp;initial review of the available historical, legal, and sociological literature on the US prisoners&rsquo; rights movement suggested that this topic would not be as useful for farmed animal advocates, for the following reasons:</span></p><ul class="c19 lst-kix_list_1-0 start"><li class="c2 c11"><span>Much of the advocacy for prisoners&rsquo; rights has come from prisoners themselves.</span><sup class="c10"><a href="#ftnt5" id="ftnt_ref5">[5]</a></sup><span class="c7 c6">&nbsp;This substantially reduces comparability with the farmed animal movement; farmed animals&rsquo; resistance to their treatment (e.g. a cow who kicks a farm worker) may cause a few human injuries and result in a very small number of animals lost in efforts to escape, but the farmed animal movement is driven by human allies.</span></li><li class="c2 c11"><span>Much of the identified literature on the topic of prisoners&rsquo; rights has focused on the effectiveness (or lack of effectiveness) of litigation by prisoners and their legal advisors. Although there has been some discussion of other forms of activism by convicts and ex-convicts,</span><sup class="c10"><a href="#ftnt6" id="ftnt_ref6">[6]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;there exists little discussion of grassroots tactics or political advocacy by allies of convicts, despite these tactics being at least somewhat common in the movement before 1980.</span><sup class="c10"><a href="#ftnt7" id="ftnt_ref7">[7]</a></sup></li><li class="c2 c11"><span>There does not seem to have been as much polling on prisoners&rsquo; rights and wellbeing as there has been on topics such as the death penalty or abortion.</span><sup class="c10"><a href="#ftnt8" id="ftnt_ref8">[8]</a></sup><span class="c7 c6">&nbsp;This makes evaluation of the successes of the prisoners&rsquo; rights movement more difficult and means that some questions of strategic interest, such as the interaction of institutional change and public opinion, cannot be directly examined.</span></li></ul><p class="c2 c16"><span class="c7 c6"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c6">As a result, this case study is much shorter than SI&rsquo;s other reports. Readers are encouraged to prioritize reading those reports and to view this case study as supplementary. In other ways, however, this report uses similar methodology and framing to SI&rsquo;s previous social movement case studies. This report may also be valuable as an application of our methodologies to a context we usually wouldn&rsquo;t cover, helping us understand the costs and benefits.</span></p><h2 class="c14" id="h.3znysh7"><span class="c25 c6">Summary of Key Implications</span></h2><ul class="c19 lst-kix_list_2-0 start"><li class="c2 c11"><span class="c7 c6">Litigation can improve welfare for the intended beneficiaries of a movement.</span></li><li class="c2 c11"><span class="c7 c6">Litigation can draw public attention to an issue.</span></li><li class="c2 c11"><span class="c7 c6">Litigation may have unintended negative consequences, such as entrenching and legitimizing institutions that advocates are opposed to.</span></li><li class="c2 c11"><span class="c7 c6">Laws and rulings that are intended to promote rights and welfare through particular mechanisms may permit the continued worsening of welfare through other mechanisms.</span></li><li class="c2 c11"><span class="c7 c6">Incremental successes of improving welfare may distract advocates&rsquo; attention from more important political and systemic issues.</span></li><li class="c2 c11"><span class="c7 c6">Social movements based heavily on a strategy of litigation (or perhaps any single strategy) seem to be fragile.</span></li><li class="c2 c11"><span class="c7 c6">People are less willing to sanction harm against individuals than against abstract groups of beings.</span></li></ul><h1 class="c23" id="h.2et92p0"><span class="c6 c31">A Condensed Chronological History of the US Prisoners&rsquo; Rights Movement</span></h1><h2 class="c14" id="h.5k7ihaywq0jc"><span class="c6"><a class="c12" href="https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/death-penalty#early-history-of-the-adpm">Early history of US prisoners&rsquo;</a></span><span class="c6 c25">&nbsp;rights</span></h2><p class="c2"><span class="c6">The 1689 English Bill of Rights declared that &ldquo;cruell and unusuall Punishments&rdquo; ought not to be inflicted</span><sup class="c10 c6"><a href="#ftnt9" id="ftnt_ref9">[9]</a></sup><span class="c6">&nbsp;and the US Bill of Rights (created 1789), prohibited the infliction of &ldquo;cruel and unusual punishments&rdquo; in the Eighth Amendment.</span><sup class="c10 c6"><a href="#ftnt10" id="ftnt_ref10">[10]</a></sup><span class="c6">&nbsp;</span><span>Although there has presumably long been some concern for the wellbeing of prisoners and criminals receiving punishment, the modern interest in prisoners&rsquo; rights seems to have developed towards the end of the 18</span><span class="c10">th</span><span>&nbsp;century, with publications by thinkers such as Cesare Beccaria.</span><sup class="c10"><a href="#ftnt11" id="ftnt_ref11">[11]</a></sup></p><p class="c2 c16"><span class="c7 c6"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>The US has experienced occasional prisoners&rsquo; rights activism since shortly after the country&rsquo;s formation, such as from Quakers and the Philadelphia Society for Alleviating the Miseries of Public Prisons, which was established in 1787.</span><sup class="c10"><a href="#ftnt12" id="ftnt_ref12">[12]</a></sup></p><p class="c2 c16"><span class="c7 c6"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>A 19th-century Virginia Supreme Court ruling referred to convicts as, &ldquo;for the time being a slave, in a condition of penal servitude to the State, and subject to such laws and regulations as the State may choose to prescribe.&rdquo;</span><sup class="c10"><a href="#ftnt13" id="ftnt_ref13">[13]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;The approach of the courts to prison cases before the 1960s is often referred to as &ldquo;hands-off.&rdquo;</span><sup class="c10"><a href="#ftnt14" id="ftnt_ref14">[14]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;Before this point, prisoners rarely litigated for their rights,</span><sup class="c10"><a href="#ftnt15" id="ftnt_ref15">[15]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;because the main available legal remedy was to petition for a writ of habeas corpus, which could only result in release, rather than the improvement of conditions.</span><sup class="c10"><a href="#ftnt16" id="ftnt_ref16">[16]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;The conditions in many prisons were poor.</span><sup class="c10"><a href="#ftnt17" id="ftnt_ref17">[17]</a></sup></p><p class="c2 c16"><span class="c7 c6"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>Nevertheless, during the 19th and early 20th centuries, there was a move away from purely retributive systems for prisoners to systems that aimed to rehabilitate.

Moreover, juveniles were frequently incarcerated in adult jails where they were routinely subjected to extreme abuse&hellip; Administrators frequently ran their institutions as fiefdoms, with little awareness of developments in legal norms or corrections administration. In some systems, dominant inmates operating as building tenders or trustees wielded supervisory, administrative, and disciplinary authority over other inmates, and engaged in violent and predatory behavior with official acquiescence. Guard brutality was a routine part of prison life. Institutions routinely segregated inmates by race, and frequently provided grossly inferior conditions, programs, and opportunities to nonwhite inmates.

Going back at least as far back as the 1850s, American prisons periodically have been gripped by waves of riots and other disturbances, some of which dominated national headlines for days. In the early twentieth century there were several periods of major unrest immediately before and after World War I, and then again in the late 1920s and at the onset of the Great Depression. These disturbances prompted President Herbert Hoover and other public officials to push for major increases in federal spending on prisons and for a series of changes in the penal system to relieve overcrowding and other problems. Major prison unrest in the late 1920s in upstate New York prompted the state to build the &lsquo;ultimate prison.&rsquo; In 1931, New York officials opened the world&rsquo;s most expensive prison to date in Attica, which was billed as &lsquo;paradise for convicts.&rsquo; Aside from Hoover&rsquo;s federal initiative and some individual state efforts, these earlier waves of prison riots and protests did not insinuate themselves into the political fabric and public consciousness&hellip; People who were imprisoned lacked significant internal organizations to sustain their mobilizations&hellip; [P]risoners&rsquo; demands largely were related to calls for improvements in their day-to-day living conditions.&rdquo;</span></p></div><div><p class="c8"><a href="#ftnt_ref25" id="ftnt25">[25]</a><span class="c5">&nbsp;Eric Cummins, </span><span class="c9 c5">The Rise and Fall of California&rsquo;s Radical Prison Movement</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;(Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1994), 20, citing the US Congress Select Committee on Crime. </span></p><p class="c8 c16"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5">Marie Gottschalk, </span><span class="c9 c5">The Prison and the Gallows: The Politics of Mass Incarceration in America</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;(New York: Cambridge University Press, 2006), 170 notes that, &ldquo;[f]rom 1950 to 1953, the country experienced more than fifty major prison disturbances, most of them in the North and West&hellip; Until the upheavals of the 1970s, this period was considered the worst ever by prison administrators.&rdquo;</span></p></div><div><p class="c8"><a href="#ftnt_ref26" id="ftnt26">[26]</a><span class="c5">&nbsp;Eric Cummins, </span><span class="c9 c5">The Rise and Fall of California&rsquo;s Radical Prison Movement</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;(Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1994), 1-64, especially 61.

The LDF viewed prison litigation as part of a broader effort to expand its activities in the mid-1960s beyond explicitly racial issues.

In artfully produced television ads, Nixon&rsquo;s steady voice, cast over haunting music and graphic images of urban riots and militant youth protests, promised to defend &lsquo;decent citizens&rsquo; from the threat of &lsquo;domestic violence&rsquo; posed by street criminals and leftist radicals. Nixon&rsquo;s speeches and television ads conflated radical protest with street crime, and fueled a cultural discourse that interpreted both as products of Kennedy and Johnson era liberalism and an inadequate US criminal justice system. Like Goldwater, Nixon deliberately employed racially coded law-and-order rhetoric in order to appeal to urban whites fearful of increased crime rates and the perceived excesses of the black liberation struggle. As special counsel to the President, John Ehrlichman, explained of his boss&rsquo;s strategy, &lsquo;that subliminal appeal to the anti-black voter was always present in Nixon&rsquo;s statements and speeches.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c8 c16"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5">Carol S.

Universities sponsored prison &lsquo;teach-ins.&rsquo; Bay Area newspapers ran expos&eacute;s of conditions in California prisons and provided extensive coverage of the growing convict unrest. Attorney groups such as Fay Stender&rsquo;s Prison Law Project, its later splinter group the Prison Law Collective, and the National Lawyers Guild were receiving thousands of letters from prisoners complaining of conditions and alleging unfair treatment. Movement attorneys took on the grueling task of representing in court as many inmates as they could.

The Civil Rights Act of 1964 gave the Department of Justice authority to sue for integration of public institutions. The Justice Department filed its first correctional desegregation lawsuit in 1969. For more than a decade after that it was seriously involved in prison and jail desegregation. It initiated its own desegregation investigations and intervened in many desegregation lawsuits initiated by private parties. The Civil Rights Division often used the desegregation lawsuits as an opening to challenge more general conditions in prisons and jails, even though its authority to do so rested on shakier legal ground. By 1980, the Department of Justice had been a key player in more than ten of the largest and most comprehensive prison cases and in many jail cases.&rdquo;</span></p></div><div><p class="c8"><a href="#ftnt_ref62" id="ftnt62">[62]</a><span class="c5">&nbsp;James B.

A part of the victim rights movement emerged out of the feminist movement&#39;s concern for battered women and rape victims which led to the first shelters and rape crisis centers in the early 1970s (Tierney 1982; Rose 1977; Matthews 1989; Matthews 1994). There are also groups that deal with criminal fatalities and bereavement like Parents of Murdered Children founded in 1978 (Villamoare and Benvenuti 1988), or anti-drunk driving groups like RID (Remove Intoxicated Drivers - USA) started in 1978, and MADD (Mothers Against Drunk Driving) founded in 1980 (Weed 1987). There are also a few groups that deal with the abuse, molestation, or abduction of children (Johnson 1989; Best 1989). There are more general victim advocacy groups at the local level such as VOCAL (Victims of Crime and Leniency). Finally, there are the Federal-State-County funded victim-witness programs started in 1974 to increase the cooperation of crime victims in prosecuting a legal case (Karman 1990). Some of these organizations with local affiliates have national offices that exist alongside national level umbrella organizations such as National Organization for Victim Assistance, Inc. (NOVA) founded in 1976 and the National Victim Center founded in 1985 (Carrington and Nicholson 1989; Weed 1995).&rdquo;</span></p></div><div><p class="c8"><a href="#ftnt_ref65" id="ftnt65">[65]</a><span class="c5">&nbsp;Katherine Beckett and Theodore Sasson, </span><span class="c9 c5">The Politics of Injustice: Crime and Punishment in America</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;(Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications, 2004), 141.

In complicated &lsquo;totality of conditions&rsquo; cases, federal judges have sometimes turned to special masters to help monitor compliance, gather information, and resolve ongoing disputes between the parties. But the special master is not an institutional panacea either. If the master lacks a full-time appointment and a staff, which is usually the case, he may simply not possess the capacity to see that a structural injunction is fully implemented.

The point we make in the book is that the prisoner rights cases did not really have a strong independent theory about the proper way to run a prison.

In other words, they were not creating new norms, but imposing norms from these two national institutions on state prisons that diverged from them, particularly those in the South where the plantation model prevailed.

Called by Governor Joseph Brennan, ostensibly to crack down on a racket run by &ldquo;powerful inmate bosses,&rdquo; the lockdown confined MSP prisoners to their cells 24 hours a day for over two months, required the assistance of approximately 150 state troopers, and cost the state over $500,000. The lockdown led to a thorough overhaul of conditions in MSP, as acting Warden Donald Allen eliminated the furlough program, Sunday family picnics, the Inmates Advisory Council, and most other reforms won by prisoners in the early 1970s. Changes at MSP mirrored national prison trends. The scrapping of rehabilitative programs corresponded with astronomical prison expansion during the following three decades as Maine&rsquo;s prison population grew from roughly 840 in 1980 to over 2100 by 2007, and the national prison population expanded from approximately 500,000 to over 2.3 million during the same period.&rdquo;</span></p></div><div><p class="c8"><a href="#ftnt_ref83" id="ftnt83">[83]</a><span class="c5">&nbsp;James B.

Wilson &mdash; then Superintendent of Police in Chicago. According to Carrington, the AELE was formed to support law enforcement, and to provide an effective counter-voice to the American Civil Liberties Union on behalf of the law-abiding citizen. It carried this effort forward by filing amicus briefs to defend the legal authority of the police in cases before the U.S. Supreme Court, as well as by serving as a clearinghouse for lawyers and police departments involved in defending police officers in civil suits filed against them.

In 1976 the National Organization for Victim Assistance (NOVA) was formed to provide support and coordination of victims&rsquo; rights advocacy efforts at the national level.

This waning support owed, in part, to a combination of limitations within the prison movement and expanded policing and retributive legislation.

Before the 1960&rsquo;s, courts did not involve themselves in the issue of prisoners&rsquo; rights. In the early 1960&rsquo;s, lower Federal courts began moving away from the hands-off approach. They showed an increasing willingness to identify rights of inmates found in the U.S. Constitution and to protect those rights. The Deference Period began in 1979 with the</span><span class="c9 c5">&nbsp;Bell v. Wolfish</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;decision. The Supreme Court resolved five issues in that case and ruled against the inmates on all of them. In ruling against the inmates, the Court set the tone for the Deference Period. During this period, inmates would lose on most prisoners&rsquo; rights issues before the U.S. Supreme Court, which would emphasize the need to give deference to the expertise of corrections officials.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c8 c16"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Susan Easton, </span><span class="c9 c5">Prisoners&rsquo; Rights: Principles and Practice</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;(Abingdon, UK: Routledge, 2011), 42-3 summarizes that in </span><span class="c9 c5">Bell v.

Many states have their own Joe Arpaio (in Massachusetts, we have Bristol County Sheriff Thomas Hodgson, who has single-handedly brought the chain gang to the state).

Indeed, every prison in California is subject to numerous ongoing court orders governing conditions of confinement... California&rsquo;s very large bar includes a critical mass of highly expert prisoners&rsquo; rights lawyers. Working for both nonprofits and for-profit firms, they benefited from a pipeline of large-scale, pre-PLRA, fees-paying cases that sustained them while they learned to cope with the statutory obstacles. And the Ninth Circuit&rsquo;s hospitable bench awarded them some favorable fee-related rulings in support of their coping strategies. In short, they learned how to&mdash;just barely&mdash;maintain a prisoners&rsquo; rights docket, notwithstanding very substantial financial hurdles. They continue to litigate old and new cases, but ongoing challenges pose a real threat to the fragile litigation ecosystem they have created.&rdquo;</span></p></div><div><p class="c8"><a href="#ftnt_ref164" id="ftnt164">[164]</a><span class="c5">&nbsp;Kitty Calavita and Valerie Jenness, </span><span class="c9 c5">Appealing to Justice: Prisoner Grievances, Rights, and Carceral Logic </span><span class="c0">(Oakland, CA: University of California Press, 2015), 19, also focusing on evidence from California, note that, &ldquo;the predicted decline in prisoner litigation subsequent to the PLRA was paralleled by a dramatic increase in prisoner grievance filing.&rdquo; On page 33, they add that, &ldquo;[i]n the year following the system&rsquo;s establishment [i.e. 1974], only about 500 prisoner appeals made their way through the system, as compared to more than 16,000 thirty years later.

However, litigation and professionalization have not occurred in isolation. Litigators and courts rely on professional standards and experts to evaluate the adequacy of conditions and practices and to apply those standards in a particular institutional context. The corrections field has, in turn, developed standards, rules, and regulations with an eye toward avoiding further judicial intervention.

Levels of fear remained strikingly constant from 1965 through the 1990s, despite the fact that crime rose markedly in the 1960s and declined significantly in the early 1990s. Similarly, a preponderance of evidence disconfirms the hypothesis that criminal vicitimization increases support for harsh crime policies. Individual-level data show that people with high risks of criminal victimization are the least punitive. Consider, for example, that African American experience more criminal victimization than other racial groups, but historically African Americans as a group are not the loudest advocates for punishment expansion; on the contrary, African Americans have opposed drug-related mandatory minimums and capital punishment in higher percentages than their comparatively safe white counterparts. In sum, &lsquo;the politics of law and order has a life of its own which is quite independent of crime and criminal victimization.&rsquo;&rdquo; A large number of references are provided, though the author has not followed any of these up.</span></p></div><div><p class="c8"><a href="#ftnt_ref230" id="ftnt230">[230]</a><span class="c5">&nbsp;&ldquo;Life imprisonment: A policy briefing,&rdquo; Penal Reform International and University of Nottingham (April 2018), </span><span class="c13 c5"><a class="c12" href="https://s16889.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/PRI_Life-Imprisonment-Briefing.pdf">https://s16889.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/PRI_Life-Imprisonment-Briefing.pdf</a></span><span class="c0">, 3.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">Even though the percentage is higher in the UK, this still only means that 13.4 people per 100,000 in the national population are serving life sentences, compared to 50.3 in the US.</span></p></div><div><p class="c8"><a href="#ftnt_ref231" id="ftnt231">[231]</a><span class="c5">&nbsp;&ldquo;Highest to Lowest - Prison Population Rate,&rdquo; World Prison Brief </span><span class="c13 c5"><a class="c12" href="http://www.prisonstudies.org/highest-to-lowest/prison_population_rate">http://www.prisonstudies.org/highest-to-lowest/prison_population_rate</a></span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">&nbsp;By comparison, England and Wales have 139 and Liechtenstein has 31.</span></p></div><div><p class="c8"><a href="#ftnt_ref232" id="ftnt232">[232]</a><span class="c5">&nbsp;Susan Easton, </span><span class="c9 c5">Prisoners&rsquo; Rights: Principles and Practice</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;(Abingdon, UK: Routledge, 2011), 97 summarizes that, &ldquo;[i]n contrast to the Netherlands, the prison system in the United States has a reputation for penal austerity.

Population limits in state correctional institutions have in some cases caused delays in the transfer of sentenced prisoners to state custody, thereby dramatically increasing overcrowding in local jails.&rdquo;</span></p></div><div><p class="c8"><a href="#ftnt_ref241" id="ftnt241">[241]</a><span class="c5">&nbsp;Susan P. Sturm, &ldquo;Legacy and Future of Corrections Litigation,&rdquo; </span><span class="c9 c5">University of Pennsylvania Law Review</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;142 (1993), 681-3 explains that, &ldquo;[a]nalysis of the case studies suggests several factors that prompt government officials to change in response to court intervention. First, discovery mechanisms and monitoring devices serve to uncover the existence of gross inadequacies in prison conditions that are otherwise insulated from sustained public scrutiny. Extensive and sustained media attention paid to corrections litigation creates pressure to address these inadequacies. Second, the case studies suggest that corrections officials are motivated to achieve compliance with court orders by an overwhelming desire to get rid of judicial involvement and oversight&hellip; This response appears to be particularly pronounced where judicial oversight has been active and where courts have used judicial sanctions to respond to noncompliance. Third, major corrections litigation is frequently accompanied by an influx of expertise and resources that expands the capacity of government officials to manage the process of reform and to maintain constitutional facilities. Finally, prisoners&rsquo; rights litigators have developed a considerable presence in the corrections world and have been able to pursue litigation on a wide scale. In systems that have a centralized administration, administrators are likely to be aware of litigation against a major institution, even if the entire system is not under scrutiny. Unlike many areas of public interest advocacy, there is no shortage of individuals willing to file corrections litigation challenging conditions of confinement in prisons. Prisoners have both the time and inclination to file litigation. Although most of these cases never make it past a motion to dismiss, some do lead to the appointment of extremely competent counsel. Thus, many correctional administrators view litigation as a fact of life that must be addressed.&rdquo;</span></p></div><div><p class="c8"><a href="#ftnt_ref242" id="ftnt242">[242]</a><span class="c5">&nbsp;Susan P.

On the last point, Sturm notes that, &ldquo;[j]udges and litigators have developed more cooperative forms of factfinding, remedial formulation, and monitoring that minimize the adverse effects of the adversary process and enhance the possibility of cooperative approaches to solving the problems identified through litigation or the threat of litigation. These approaches include: (1) the use of expert panels selected by the parties to perform factfinding, assist in developing remedies and monitor compliance; (2) the use of court-supervised mediation to achieve a consensual remedy that addresses the problems underlying constitutional violations; (3) the use of existing oversight mechanisms in the enforcement stage, such as state regulatory agencies and the accreditation process; (4) the use of monitoring mechanisms that employ defendants&rsquo; employees as compliance officers; and (5) consolidation of cases involving related institutions to avoid the tendency to displace problems to institutions not under the purview of a particular court.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c8 c16"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Malcolm M.

In 1965, southern prisons were distinctly different from those in other parts of the United States; by the 1980s this was no longer the case. Precisely how much value one attaches to this change depends upon one&rsquo;s views. Some observers might share John DiIulio&rsquo;s preference for well-run plantation-style prisons, while others might view all American prisons as so repressive that the variation in form is insignificant. But whatever one&rsquo;s evaluation of the change, it seems clear that a distinct, extensive change had been effectuated by the federal courts&hellip; That is not to say that courts acted entirely on their own. As discussed in Chapter 5, reform movements were initiated in several southern states. In Florida, the effort was carried to completion without comprehensive court orders and indeed before courts began an active role in conditions cases. In other states, such as Louisiana, it fizzled, but nonetheless indicated that there were forces in these states that would support the judicial effort. Once the courts issued their orders, moreover, they found allies from both inside and outside the prison system.&rdquo; On pages 368-73, they also argue that prison reform litigation promoted professionalization, bureaucratization, and homogenization of national standards in the correctional system.</span></p></div><div><p class="c8"><a href="#ftnt_ref243" id="ftnt243">[243]</a><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c15">Edward Rubin</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;believes (private email exchange, received June 16, 2020) that, &ldquo;[m]any of the lawyers involved were not primarily concerned with prison conditions.

In the late 1960s, Simon, motivated by the racial disparities in death sentences, turned his attention to death penalty cases in Florida. Simon&rsquo;s trips to death row exposed him to the brutal conditions at Florida State Prison, where cells designed for two housed 10, and inmate &lsquo;medics&rsquo; provided medical &lsquo;treatment&rsquo; to other inmates. Looking for an opportunity to address overcrowding, in 1972 Simon agreed to represent two inmates who had filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida about inadequate medical care at Florida State Prison. District Judge Charles R. Scott, one of the active pro&ndash;civil rights judges in the South, knew Simon well and had previously signaled his respect for the &lsquo;advantages of the class device&rsquo; in Simon&rsquo;s work on the death penalty. Within a few months, Simon had added overcrowding to the complaint, and Judge Scott certified it as a class action on February 22, 1973. Extending the successful framework from death penalty lawsuits, the amended complaint sued Louie Wainwright, the director of the Florida Division of Corrections (later renamed the Florida Department of Corrections), for relief from overcrowding and inadequate medical care that caused &lsquo;substantial harm to inmates in violation of the Eighth Amendment prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></p></div><div><p class="c8"><a href="#ftnt_ref250" id="ftnt250">[250]</a><span class="c5">&nbsp;Heather Schoenfeld, &ldquo;Mass Incarceration and the Paradox of Prison Conditions Litigation,&rdquo; </span><span class="c9 c5">Law and Society Review</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;44, no. 3&#8208;4 (2010), 731-68. On page 741, Schoenfeld summarizes that, &ldquo;Judge Scott selectively relied on a report by the American Justice Institute (the &lsquo;AJI report&rsquo;) submitted in Simon&rsquo;s application for injunction. He chose to use its concept of &lsquo;prison capacity&rsquo;&mdash;ordering the defendants to &lsquo;reduce the overall inmate population&rsquo; in five stages over one year to &lsquo;emergency capacity,&rsquo; defined as &lsquo;the population beyond which the institution must be considered critically, and quite probably, dangerously overcrowded,&rsquo; and in 18 months to &lsquo;normal capacity,&rsquo; defined as &lsquo;that population which an institution can properly accommodate on an average daily basis.&rsquo;&rdquo; However, &ldquo;by focusing the relief on &lsquo;capacity&rsquo; rather than a reduction of the prison population as originally asked for by the plaintiffs, Judge Scott&rsquo;s order left open the possibility of compliance by prison growth.&rdquo; Pages 741-51 describe various legal and political developments that meant that various attempted solutions to the overcrowding problem were insufficient. As a result, Schoenfeld notes on page 751 that, from the late 1980s, Florida legislators approved what they later referred to as &ldquo;an aggressive prison construction program.&rdquo;</span></p></div><div><p class="c8"><a href="#ftnt_ref251" id="ftnt251">[251]</a><span class="c5">&nbsp;Heather Schoenfeld, &ldquo;Mass Incarceration and the Paradox of Prison Conditions Litigation,&rdquo; </span><span class="c9 c5">Law and Society Review</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;44, no. 3&#8208;4 (2010), 733 argues that, &ldquo;[i]n the long run, compliance with the court order increased the state&rsquo;s capacity and willingness to incarcerate, leading to the further expansion of incarceration throughout the 1990s in ways that continued to disproportionately impact black Americans.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c8 c16"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">Schoenfeld notes on page 732 that, &ldquo;[s]ince 1973, the incarceration rate in the United States has grown by 700 percent,&rdquo; and on page 752 that, &ldquo;[b]y 1993, when Costello was finally settled, 50,000 people were incarcerated in Florida&rsquo;s state prisons&mdash;up from just below 20,000 in 1980. In the next 15 years, the state prison population grew by another 50,000.&rdquo; Though Schoenfeld provides evidence that Florida incarcerated more people and became tougher on crime, no evidence is provided that the increased availability of prisons actually encouraged this development. Indeed, the article provides evidence that increases in prison capacity were a response to overcrowding and the insufficient supply of prison beds. There does not appear to have ever been a substantial oversupply of prison beds which were somehow free to be filled by whoever state officials might have decided to incarcerate.</span></p></div><div><p class="c8"><a href="#ftnt_ref252" id="ftnt252">[252]</a><span class="c5">&nbsp;Heather Schoenfeld, &ldquo;Mass Incarceration and the Paradox of Prison Conditions Litigation,&rdquo; </span><span class="c9 c5">Law and Society Review</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;44, no. 3&#8208;4 (2010), 731, citing Margo Schlanger, &ldquo;Civil Rights Injunctions Over Time: A Case Study of Jail and Prison Court Orders,&rdquo; </span><span class="c9 c5">New York University Law Review </span><span class="c0">81 (2006), 560, claims that &ldquo;[t]he civil rights lawyers who represented [prison inmates] not only sought to extend hard-fought &lsquo;rights&rsquo; to prisoners, but they also &lsquo;had extraordinary high hopes that . . .

Increased newspaper coverage appears to be associated with greater increases in resources for police, prosecutors, and convicted offenders, while inversely related to the interests of defendants and corrections officials.

Only one question of use was found: &lsquo;What are the major problems facing the country today?&rsquo; This open-ended item was used by Gallup for literally decades, and fortunately there were special tabulations for California. For every 6-month period we summed the proportion of mentions received by crime-related responses and used yearly means as the independent variable predicting the passage of Penal Code legislation&hellip; Our measure of public opinion shows no interesting patterns of association with the legislation, whether for simultaneous occurrence of with a 1-year lag. Part of the reason for the low correlations may be the small size of the California sample [under 100]... However, examination of Figure 6.4, showing public concern with crime-related issues over time, suggest consistent trends, not a random pattern. Public concern increases dramatically after 1967, but the increases appear to </span><span class="c9 c5">follow </span><span class="c0">trends in legislation.&rdquo; They argue that this shows that public opinion does not predict the legislation, but seems to follow it. They add that their &ldquo;quantitative analysis and graphs&hellip; suggested shifts in legislative mood during the mid-1960s. Yet, Figure 6.4 indicates that it too until 1968 for the public to abstract law and order as a special and overriding problem. Ironically, 1968 is the year of Sieroty&rsquo;s Prisoner Rights Bill and a year when liberal forces were already beginning an effective counterattack.&rdquo;</span></p></div><div><p class="c8"><a href="#ftnt_ref283" id="ftnt283">[283]</a><span class="c5">&nbsp;Katherine Beckett and Theodore Sasson, </span><span class="c9 c5">The Politics of Injustice: Crime and Punishment in America</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;(Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications, 2004), 100.

However, when given a description of an actual case of a man sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of his severely disabled daughter, three quarters of the polled public voted against the imposition of the mandatory sentence of life imprisonment (Angus Reid, 1999). This finding&mdash;support for the law accompanied by a reluctance to impose the law in specific cases&mdash;echoes the results from the American research on mandatory Three Strikes sentences. Specifically, the mandatory sentence appeals to the public in principle, but once confronted with actual cases, people quickly resile from their position and express a preference for a less punitive punishment. </span></p><p class="c8 c16"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The difference between respondents&rsquo; views in response to general and case-specific questions also applies to opinions about capital punishment in the United States and parole eligibility for life prisoners in Canada. With respect to the death penalty in the United States, although a high percentage of Americans has always supported the use of capital punishment, when asked to consider the imposition of this sentence in specific cases, support for the death penalty drops significantly (see Cullen et al., 2000; Roberts &amp; Stalans, 1997). When provided with actual case descriptions, survey respondents tend to favor less punitive sentencing options (e.g., Cumberland &amp; Zamble, 1992; Zamble &amp; Kalm, 1990).</span></p><p class="c8 c16"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Although surveys show that the majority of the Canadian public are opposed to the possibility of parole for lifers at any point, juries composed of members of the public routinely reduce parole eligibility periods after being provided with information about offenders (see Roberts, 2002).
