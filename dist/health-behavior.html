<meta name="citation_abstract" content="There is an extensive research literature on the effectiveness of various interventions for changing health behaviors, such as dietary habits, physical activity, and smoking. Existing reviews and overviews tend to aggregate research on the effects of specific interventions on particular health behaviors. This review provides a largely qualitative, non-statistical summary of the evidence for the effectiveness of intervention types across health behaviors, by aggregating 706 research items (mostly systematic reviews and meta-analyses) based on the strength of evidence. This review makes a number of subjective judgment calls and uses novel methods of evaluation in order to quickly digest and summarize an extremely large evidence base. It focuses on applications to the farmed animal movement, especially to the behavioral change of reducing animal product consumption. In general, while the health behavior literature includes a very large number of studies, there is much inconsistency in wording, methodology, and subject matter, which makes it difficult to extract useful insights for behavior change advocates. However, some conclusions are warranted. Key findings include that almost all types of health behavior interventions targeted at individuals or small groups seem likely to have effect sizes conventionally interpreted as “small” or “very small,” that their effect sizes tend to be even smaller in the long term, and that interventions with educational and behavioral components outperform solely educational interventions.">

The study of health behavior is a vast subject area, drawing not only on medical science but also on social sciences such as behavioral economics and psychology. </span></p><p class="c0 c20"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">While we are generally interested in what the health behavior literature can tell us about changing behavior, our particular focus is on animal product consumption and other behaviors of interest to the farmed animal movement, such as participating in demonstrations against factory farming, though animal product consumption seems most similar to typical health behavior changes. We decided to write this literature review because, as an international and well-funded field, health behavior seemed likely to have a fuller evidence base, and perhaps more certain conclusions, than exist currently in the farmed animal movement. Of course, there are many differences between the farmed animal and health behavior contexts which mean that conclusions in one field will not automatically transfer across to the other. However, if some features, trends, or effects are consistent across several different health behaviors, then it seems more likely that these findings will transfer to the farmed animal context. </span></p><p class="c0 c20"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>External findings</span><span>&nbsp;from the health behavior field can therefore provide </span><span>weak evidence</span><span>&nbsp;for animal advocacy strategy. </span><span>Although this review draws strategic implications from the health behavior literature, these implications are only valid insofar as we place weight on external evidence, and should always be interpreted in the context of other available evidence.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt3" id="ftnt_ref3">[3]</a></sup></p><h2 class="c37" id="h.3b0glni7onf2"><span>Summary of strategic implications</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c29 c52">Below are a number of strategic claims supported by the evidence in this review:</span></p><ul class="c32 lst-kix_k4plbo7sfvzn-0 start"><li class="c0 c21"><span>In the health behavior literature, </span><span>almost all types of </span><span class="c2">health behavior interventions seem likely to have effect sizes conventionally interpreted as &ldquo;small&rdquo; or &ldquo;very small.&rdquo; The overall differences between intervention types seem minor, despite substantial variance between individual studies or meta-analyses, so animal advocates should usually not expect large differences between intervention types without additional evidence.</span></li><li class="c0 c21"><span>Incentives, price changes, bans on undesired behavior, and other forms of policy change seem to have larger effect sizes than most individual or small group interventions.</span></li><li class="c0 c21"><span>A few techniques have correlational evidence for their effectiveness. These include the provision of instruction, prompting of specific goal setting, prompting of self-monitoring of behavior, prompting of practice, facilitation of social comparison, barrier identification or problem solving, social support, and interpersonal skills training.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt4" id="ftnt_ref4">[4]</a></sup></li><li class="c0 c21"><span>Indirect comparisons between studies suggest that interventions with educational and behavioral components outperform solely educational interventions. Specific behavioral components that show promise include </span><span>action planning, implementation intentions</span><span>, goal setting, and motivational interviewing.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt5" id="ftnt_ref5">[5]</a></sup></li><li class="c0 c21"><span class="c2">Although various forms of mass media interventions are frequently used in the farmed animal movement, the evidence for the effectiveness of such tactics in the health behavior literature is surprisingly weak.</span></li><li class="c0 c21"><span class="c2">There is little evidence that bans on the advertising of unhealthy products are effective in reducing consumption.</span></li><li class="c0 c21"><span class="c2">Reviews tend to find evidence that &ldquo;nudges&rdquo; can be effective at changing behavior, though effect sizes are probably small. There is stronger evidence that modifying the size of portions, packaging, or tableware affects consumption than there is for other types of nudges.</span></li><li class="c0 c21"><span>There is relatively strong evidence that interventions delivered remotely, such as through telephones, text messages, or computers, can be effective at changing behavior, though as with other interventions, overall effect sizes tend to be &ldquo;small&rdquo; or &ldquo;very small.&rdquo; Differences in behavioral effects between face-to-face interventions and remote delivery are often </span><span>not</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;statistically significant, though indirect comparison between the different effect size estimates within meta-analyses suggests that face-to-face interventions have slightly larger behavioral effects than otherwise similar non face-to-face interventions.</span></li><li class="c0 c21"><span class="c2">Contrary to expectations, interventions delivered in group format seem to have very slightly larger behavioral effects than individual interventions. </span></li><li class="c0 c21"><span class="c2">There is little evidence that the effect of behavior change interventions depends on particular settings such as schools, family homes, or workplaces.</span></li><li class="c0 c21"><span class="c2">There is some evidence that &ldquo;brief interventions&rdquo; can be effective and have small effect sizes (as other health behavior interventions do). Additionally, there is some evidence that brief interventions are not made more effective by increasing the amount of contact time involved in interactions.</span></li><li class="c0 c21"><span class="c2">There is some evidence that the distribution of print-based materials can positively affect behavior, but one review found negative effects on motivation.</span></li><li class="c0 c21"><span class="c2">Broadly, the health behavior literature provides very mixed evidence regarding whether increases in the intensity of interventions &mdash; such as through greater amounts of contact time, increases in the number of contacts, or lengthened duration of the intervention &mdash; are likely to increase effectiveness. There is some evidence that increasing the number of contacts in interventions delivering tailored print-based materials increases their effectiveness, but there is surprisingly consistent evidence that increasing the intensity of online and computer-based interventions does not increase their effectiveness and some evidence that this actually reduces their effectiveness.</span></li><li class="c0 c21"><span class="c2">The evidence relating to increases in complexity (such as incorporating a larger number of behavior change techniques or carrying out an intervention in multiple settings) is mostly positive, with meta-analyses suggesting moderate to large increases in intervention effectiveness at causing behavioral change.</span></li><li class="c0 c21"><span class="c2">In aggregate, meta-analyses suggest moderate increases in intervention effectiveness from the use of tailoring (that is, where content is matched to an individual&rsquo;s characteristics or needs).</span></li><li class="c0 c21"><span class="c2">There was fairly consistent evidence that taxes, subsidies, and other interventions affecting price had greater effects on people with low socioeconomic status (SES). There was evidence that education or information only interventions are less effective among people with low SES.</span></li><li class="c0 c21"><span class="c2">The evidence relating to the long-term effects of interventions is far weaker than expected. </span></li><li class="c0 c21"><span>One-by-one diet interventions seem very unlikely to have moderate-or-large effects after one year; from the reviewed interventions, only &ldquo;direct financial incentives&rdquo; were found to have anything other than small, very small, or no effects at long-term follow-up. For all interventions where evidence was available, except school-based interventions, meta-analyses suggest that effect sizes are smaller when measured at longer follow-up. In aggregate, </span><span>indirect </span><span class="c2">comparisons between the different effect size estimates within 17 meta-analyses suggest that behavioral effects are slightly or moderately smaller when measured at follow-up points of a year or more post-intervention than when measured at shorter follow-up points.</span></li><li class="c0 c21"><span class="c2">Weaknesses of the health behavior literature, despite decades of research and huge amounts of funding, suggest serious limitations of experimental and observational research in other contexts, such as the farmed animal movement. This makes other types of evidence, such as social movement case studies, relatively more promising.</span></li><li class="c0 c21"><span>There is evidence that changing audience&rsquo;s intentions changes their behavior, but </span><span>the behavioral effect sizes tend to be smaller; meta-analyses have found effects as much as 62% smaller, though a discount rate between 25% and 50% seems more representative for converting intentional effect size to behavioral effect size.</span></li><li class="c0 c21"><span class="c2">Although this review focused on behavioral outcome measures, rather than indirect measures such as intentions or knowledge, some intervention types, such as those focused on education, either directly to individuals or via mass media, performed much better on indirect outcome measurements. This suggests that these interventions could have important effects; their impact on behavioral outcomes might only be detected with longer follow-up measurement, or if they are combined with other interventions. Such interventions could be necessary for long-term behavioral change but not sufficient to cause change without the support of other interventions.</span></li><li class="c0 c21"><span>Several social cognition models used in the health behavior literature &mdash; especially the Transtheoretical Model</span><sup><a href="#ftnt6" id="ftnt_ref6">[6]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;&mdash; seem applicable to the farmed animal movement and may help to support intervention design.</span></li></ul><h2 class="c37" id="h.nr05qbyuzrhd"><span>Appendices and supplementary spreadsheets</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Two appendices provide additional detail and discussion:</span></p><ul class="c32 lst-kix_ypyphie194qt-0 start"><li class="c0 c21"><span class="c19"><a class="c10" href="http://sentienceinstitute.org/health-behavior-appendix-a">&nbsp;Some of the included research items that had relevance for messaging considerations drew on this literature. Topics included comparison of loss-framing to gain-framing, help-self appeals compared to help-others appeals, moderators of effectiveness in mass media campaigns and in social marketing, and evaluations of the effectiveness and moderators of advertising and advertising bans. This literature may be more useful for improving messaging strategies and identifying the features of mass media campaigns that increase their effectiveness than the health behavior literature is.</span></p></div></body></html>
