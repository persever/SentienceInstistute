The study of health behavior is a vast subject area, drawing not only on medical science but also on social sciences such as behavioral economics and psychology. </span></p><p class="c0 c20"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">While we are generally interested in what the health behavior literature can tell us about changing behavior, our particular focus is on animal product consumption and other behaviors of interest to the farmed animal movement, such as participating in demonstrations against factory farming, though animal product consumption seems most similar to typical health behavior changes. We decided to write this literature review because, as an international and well-funded field, health behavior seemed likely to have a fuller evidence base, and perhaps more certain conclusions, than exist currently in the farmed animal movement. Of course, there are many differences between the farmed animal and health behavior contexts which mean that conclusions in one field will not automatically transfer across to the other. However, if some features, trends, or effects are consistent across several different health behaviors, then it seems more likely that these findings will transfer to the farmed animal context. </span></p><p class="c0 c20"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>External findings</span><span>&nbsp;from the health behavior field can therefore provide </span><span>weak evidence</span><span>&nbsp;for animal advocacy strategy. </span><span>Although this review draws strategic implications from the health behavior literature, these implications are only valid insofar as we place weight on external evidence, and should always be interpreted in the context of other available evidence.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt3" id="ftnt_ref3">[3]</a></sup></p><h2 class="c37" id="h.3b0glni7onf2"><span>Summary of strategic implications</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c29 c52">Below are a number of strategic claims supported by the evidence in this review:</span></p><ul class="c32 lst-kix_k4plbo7sfvzn-0 start"><li class="c0 c21"><span>In the health behavior literature, </span><span>almost all types of </span><span class="c2">health behavior interventions seem likely to have effect sizes conventionally interpreted as &ldquo;small&rdquo; or &ldquo;very small.&rdquo; The overall differences between intervention types seem minor, despite substantial variance between individual studies or meta-analyses, so animal advocates should usually not expect large differences between intervention types without additional evidence.</span></li><li class="c0 c21"><span>Incentives, price changes, bans on undesired behavior, and other forms of policy change seem to have larger effect sizes than most individual or small group interventions.</span></li><li class="c0 c21"><span>A few techniques have correlational evidence for their effectiveness. These include the provision of instruction, prompting of specific goal setting, prompting of self-monitoring of behavior, prompting of practice, facilitation of social comparison, barrier identification or problem solving, social support, and interpersonal skills training.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt4" id="ftnt_ref4">[4]</a></sup></li><li class="c0 c21"><span>Indirect comparisons between studies suggest that interventions with educational and behavioral components outperform solely educational interventions. Specific behavioral components that show promise include </span><span>action planning, implementation intentions</span><span>, goal setting, and motivational interviewing.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt5" id="ftnt_ref5">[5]</a></sup></li><li class="c0 c21"><span class="c2">Although various forms of mass media interventions are frequently used in the farmed animal movement, the evidence for the effectiveness of such tactics in the health behavior literature is surprisingly weak.</span></li><li class="c0 c21"><span class="c2">There is little evidence that bans on the advertising of unhealthy products are effective in reducing consumption.</span></li><li class="c0 c21"><span class="c2">Reviews tend to find evidence that &ldquo;nudges&rdquo; can be effective at changing behavior, though effect sizes are probably small. There is stronger evidence that modifying the size of portions, packaging, or tableware affects consumption than there is for other types of nudges.</span></li><li class="c0 c21"><span>There is relatively strong evidence that interventions delivered remotely, such as through telephones, text messages, or computers, can be effective at changing behavior, though as with other interventions, overall effect sizes tend to be &ldquo;small&rdquo; or &ldquo;very small.&rdquo; Differences in behavioral effects between face-to-face interventions and remote delivery are often </span><span>not</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;statistically significant, though indirect comparison between the different effect size estimates within meta-analyses suggests that face-to-face interventions have slightly larger behavioral effects than otherwise similar non face-to-face interventions.</span></li><li class="c0 c21"><span class="c2">Contrary to expectations, interventions delivered in group format seem to have very slightly larger behavioral effects than individual interventions. </span></li><li class="c0 c21"><span class="c2">There is little evidence that the effect of behavior change interventions depends on particular settings such as schools, family homes, or workplaces.</span></li><li class="c0 c21"><span class="c2">There is some evidence that &ldquo;brief interventions&rdquo; can be effective and have small effect sizes (as other health behavior interventions do). Additionally, there is some evidence that brief interventions are not made more effective by increasing the amount of contact time involved in interactions.</span></li><li class="c0 c21"><span class="c2">There is some evidence that the distribution of print-based materials can positively affect behavior, but one review found negative effects on motivation.</span></li><li class="c0 c21"><span class="c2">Broadly, the health behavior literature provides very mixed evidence regarding whether increases in the intensity of interventions &mdash; such as through greater amounts of contact time, increases in the number of contacts, or lengthened duration of the intervention &mdash; are likely to increase effectiveness. There is some evidence that increasing the number of contacts in interventions delivering tailored print-based materials increases their effectiveness, but there is surprisingly consistent evidence that increasing the intensity of online and computer-based interventions does not increase their effectiveness and some evidence that this actually reduces their effectiveness.</span></li><li class="c0 c21"><span class="c2">The evidence relating to increases in complexity (such as incorporating a larger number of behavior change techniques or carrying out an intervention in multiple settings) is mostly positive, with meta-analyses suggesting moderate to large increases in intervention effectiveness at causing behavioral change.</span></li><li class="c0 c21"><span class="c2">In aggregate, meta-analyses suggest moderate increases in intervention effectiveness from the use of tailoring (that is, where content is matched to an individual&rsquo;s characteristics or needs).</span></li><li class="c0 c21"><span class="c2">There was fairly consistent evidence that taxes, subsidies, and other interventions affecting price had greater effects on people with low socioeconomic status (SES). There was evidence that education or information only interventions are less effective among people with low SES.</span></li><li class="c0 c21"><span class="c2">The evidence relating to the long-term effects of interventions is far weaker than expected. </span></li><li class="c0 c21"><span>One-by-one diet interventions seem very unlikely to have moderate-or-large effects after one year; from the reviewed interventions, only &ldquo;direct financial incentives&rdquo; were found to have anything other than small, very small, or no effects at long-term follow-up. For all interventions where evidence was available, except school-based interventions, meta-analyses suggest that effect sizes are smaller when measured at longer follow-up. In aggregate, </span><span>indirect </span><span class="c2">comparisons between the different effect size estimates within 17 meta-analyses suggest that behavioral effects are slightly or moderately smaller when measured at follow-up points of a year or more post-intervention than when measured at shorter follow-up points.</span></li><li class="c0 c21"><span class="c2">Weaknesses of the health behavior literature, despite decades of research and huge amounts of funding, suggest serious limitations of experimental and observational research in other contexts, such as the farmed animal movement.

Where a meta-analysis included separate analyses for separate age groups, the combined effect size was included where possible, and the effect for adults was included if this was not possible. Where a study reports both dichotomous and continuous outcomes, if both are similarly comparable to behaviors of interest in the farmed animal movement, the continuous outcomes were prioritized, since many in the farmed animal movement are interested in reductions in animal product consumption and not just whether consumption is entirely eliminated, unless the evidence was notably stronger for dichotomous outcomes.</span></p><p class="c0 c20"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>When reporting on the effect sizes of different interventions and on the strength of evidence, the metrics provided by the reviewers were used.

For example, health behavior researchers have devoted significant resources to developing theories of human behavior change, which are used to inform intervention prioritization and design (see </span><span class="c19"><a class="c10" href="http://sentienceinstitute.org/health-behavior-appendix-b">Appendix B: </a></span><span class="c19"><a class="c10" href="http://sentienceinstitute.org/health-behavior-appendix-b">Theory Used in Health Behavior Intervention Design and Research</a></span><span class="c2">).</span></li><li class="c0 c21"><span>A variety of methodologies have been developed for assessing the risk of bias in individual studies, quality of systematic reviews, and quality of evidence overall.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt34" id="ftnt_ref34">[34]</a></sup></li></ul><h3 class="c25" id="h.ds16q97phpw9"><span class="c13 c40">Weaknesses of the health behavior literature</span></h3><ul class="c32 lst-kix_vou4f35aeb0i-0 start"><li class="c0 c21"><span class="c2">Many reviews use qualitative reporting, rather than meta-analyses. Sometimes, this is due to inconsistency in research design making meta-analysis inappropriate.</span></li><li class="c0 c21"><span>In general, the health behavior has less consistent and strong conclusions from research than expected. Most qualitative reviews of specific intervention types for specific outcomes include a mixture of studies finding statistically significant and insignificant effects in the main outcomes of interest. Sometimes they also include studies finding significant effects in the opposite direction to the hypothesized direction. Meta-analyses often contain substantial heterogeneity that moderator analyses are unable to explain.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt35" id="ftnt_ref35">[35]</a></sup><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span></li><li class="c0 c21"><span>For most topics, there is a lack of studies with follow-up data collection at a year or more post-intervention, meaning that long-term effects are not well understood.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt36" id="ftnt_ref36">[36]</a></sup></li><li class="c0 c21"><span class="c2">Often review authors do not discuss in detail which characteristics might explain the heterogeneity in the results of research items.</span></li><li class="c0 c21"><span class="c2">Generally there is not a strong understanding of the specific components of interventions that makes them more or less effective. In the last decade or so, the method of checking the association between BCT use and intervention effectiveness has been developed. However, due in part to the tendency for interventions to use multiple BCTs simultaneously, there is a lack of experimental evidence comparing near identical interventions in order to better understand the benefits of adding or removing a single BCT. </span></li><li class="c0 c21"><span>There is surprisingly little experimental evidence about the effect of variations in framing, messaging, and communication on behavioral outcomes.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt37" id="ftnt_ref37">[37]</a></sup></li><li class="c0 c21"><span>Many reviews fail to follow the quality recommendations of review guidelines and appraisal tools, such as AMSTAR 2.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt38" id="ftnt_ref38">[38]</a></sup></li><li class="c0 c21"><span>Often, individual studies have weaknesses in their design and risks of bias. In some reviews &mdash; or entire areas of research &mdash; the vast majority of studies share similar risks of bias or methodological flaws.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt39" id="ftnt_ref39">[39]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;Sometimes, this is for practical and understandable reasons, such as blinding of participants or assessors being difficult for some intervention types. In other cases it is avoidable, such as where studies use sample sizes that are too small and therefore insufficiently powered to detect significant differences. This latter methodological weakness can make qualitative reporting of study results especially misleading.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt40" id="ftnt_ref40">[40]</a></sup><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span></li><li class="c0 c21"><span>Some methods of reporting qualitative results seem clearer and more transparent, such as the harvest plot method.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt41" id="ftnt_ref41">[41]</a></sup><span class="c2">&nbsp;However, this method was rarely used.</span></li><li class="c0 c21"><span>Although social cognition models have been developed and used in research, there is not consistent evidence that any of them predict behavioral outcomes more accurately than the others, or that the use of particular theories leads to greater intervention effectiveness.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt42" id="ftnt_ref42">[42]</a></sup></li><li class="c0 c21"><span class="c2">In some instances, there are surprisingly few comparisons between an intervention and no intervention or a placebo. Comparison is frequently made to &ldquo;usual care&rdquo; or other active treatment types; the presence of other forms of intervention may reduce the effect size of the intervention being tested. Sometimes the studies evaluated in meta-analyses or reviews include a mixture of different types of comparators.</span></li><li class="c0 c21"><span>A large proportion of included studies were conducted in developed countries, most frequently the US.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt43" id="ftnt_ref43">[43]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;This reduces the ability of the health behavior literature to compare findings across countries.</span></li></ul><h2 class="c37" id="h.zfrbe2svsgjv"><span>Limitations</span></h2><ul class="c32 lst-kix_ux6u2b47jvjg-0 start"><li class="c0 c21"><span class="c2">There is a general risk of selection bias through using methods that were to some extent systematic but also relied on arbitrary or intuitive constraints and heuristics for when further effort to make the searches more comprehensive and thorough would lead to steeply diminishing returns.</span></li><li class="c0 c21"><span class="c2">As an attempt to balance being systematic and efficient, Google and Google Scholar were used, rather than comprehensively searching through scientific databases, and some fairly arbitrary search terms were used. Some mistakes were made in the selection of search terms which may have either resulted in a greater focus on less relevant findings (such as the initial searches made before adding the terms &ldquo;AND (behavior OR behaviour OR intervention)&rdquo;), or which arbitrarily included some terms over others (such as when the word &ldquo;intervention&rdquo; was included but &ldquo;interventions&rdquo; was not). </span></li><li class="c0 c21"><span>Although the methods used for identifying research items of potential interest were systematic to some extent, some relevant information from the identified research items may have been omitted. At the beginning of this project, it was unclear which topics would eventually be discussed in depth, and which forms of analysis would be carried out. As a result, some data that would otherwise have been relevant to an analysis included within this review may have been omitted, especially earlier on in the process.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt44" id="ftnt_ref44">[44]</a></sup><span class="c2">&nbsp;Additionally, in the interest of covering substantial amounts of the vast health behavior literature without spending excessive amounts of time on the project, some research items were read quickly, or only certain sections were read. For this reason, some cited research items may have contained additional information of interest which is not reported in this literature review. </span></li><li class="c0 c21"><span>There is a risk of overlap between the studies in included research items. If, after brief inspection, an identified review or overview seemed to have substantial overlap with those that had already been examined, this was noted in footnotes. However, it did not seem worthwhile to check for overlap of individual studies, except in cases where points were made on the basis of a small number of studies.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt45" id="ftnt_ref45">[45]</a></sup></li><li class="c0 c21"><span class="c2">By focusing on reviews, rather than individual studies, some relevant and useful information may have been missed from individual studies. Similarly, where overviews were used, the cited reviews were not always examined.</span></li><li class="c0 c21"><span>By attempting to aggregate information from studies in vastly different contexts and using varying methodologies, the findings may present a misleading impression of similarity between the findings.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt46" id="ftnt_ref46">[46]</a></sup></li><li class="c0 c21"><span class="c2">By focusing on behavioral outcomes, lots of potentially useful evidence on indirect outcomes (e.g. intentions, knowledge, and self-efficacy) has been excluded. </span></li><li class="c0 c21"><span class="c2">After an initial brief exploration, little attention was paid to the role of theory in intervention design.</span></li><li class="c0 c21"><span class="c2">The divisions into categories of intervention type are arbitrary and are based on divisions that seemed most useful and relevant to the farmed animal movement. Minor shifts in categorization could lead to different &ldquo;results&rdquo; in terms of any of the four forms of qualitative analysis undertaken in this literature review.</span></li><li class="c0 c21"><span class="c2">Most health behavior areas can involve interventions focused on either reducing health risks (often referred to as &ldquo;preventative&rdquo; interventions) or ceasing unhealthy behaviors. This review does not consistently distinguish between prevention and cessation interventions.</span></li><li class="c0 c21"><span class="c2">Although systematic reviews reduce the effects of selection bias, they do little to mitigate other risks of bias (including publication bias) in the included studies. Sometimes sensitivity analyses and trim-and-fill procedures are used to account for these risks, but they are only used infrequently. When dealing with small and very small effect sizes (as is the case with most interventions evaluated in this review), the risk of publication bias seems especially concerning.</span></li><li class="c0 c21"><span>Various analyses in this literature review are based on comparisons across arbitrary cutoff points and dichotomies.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt47" id="ftnt_ref47">[47]</a></sup></li><li class="c0 c21"><span class="c2">The author&rsquo;s lack of expertise in statistics may have meant that unusual forms of statistical analysis in the included research items (that could represent manipulation or reframing of the results) were not noticed.</span></li><li class="c0 c21"><span class="c2">Little attention was paid to whether a meta-analysis used fixed or random effects and the degree to which this may have affected results.</span></li><li class="c0 c21"><span>There are weaknesses to each of the forms of qualitative analyses used, as described above.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt48" id="ftnt_ref48">[48]</a></sup><span class="c2">&nbsp;The use of more established statistical methods would have been very time consuming and would have had other drawbacks, but may have produced more informative and reliable results.</span></li><li class="c0 c21"><span class="c2">In the analysis used in this literature review, relevance to the farmed animal movement was generally prioritized over consistency in methodology.</span></li><li class="c0 c21"><span>The heath behavior literature has a variety of methodological weaknesses itself, and so this review will likely reflect those limitations.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt49" id="ftnt_ref49">[49]</a></sup></li><li class="c0 c21"><span class="c2">Arguably, understanding the predictors of effects within particular categories of intervention is more useful than understanding the effect size estimates for broad categories of intervention types.

The author has tried to utilize some of these methods in conducting this literature review, for example (see the section on &ldquo;search strategy&rdquo; above).</span></p></div><div><p class="c22"><a href="#ftnt_ref35" id="ftnt35">[35]</a><span class="c16">&nbsp;See the column for &ldquo;Inconsistency of results&rdquo; in the tab &ldquo;GRADE individual reviews&rdquo; on the spreadsheet &ldquo;</span><span class="c4"><a class="c10" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17Q3QGrhopvbU10xhWwne1kHf7oDCF6xoBbmBloOiNPY/edit?usp%3Dsharing">Strength of Evidence Assessments</a></span><span class="c3">.&rdquo;</span></p></div><div><p class="c22"><a href="#ftnt_ref36" id="ftnt36">[36]</a><span class="c16">&nbsp;Many reviews draw attention to this limitation.

This problem may be partially due to language constraints. Many reviews only include studies published in English.</span></p></div><div><p class="c22"><a href="#ftnt_ref44" id="ftnt44">[44]</a><span class="c3">&nbsp;For example, the evaluation of the findings from behavior change technique analyses in included reviews was not initially planned, so information on BCT analyses from reviews that were looked at before making this decision may have been omitted.

Little attention has been paid to the countries in which studies were conducted; the study locations or characteristics have not been noted unless it seemed to have an especially important bearing on the results.</span></p></div><div><p class="c22"><a href="#ftnt_ref47" id="ftnt47">[47]</a><span class="c3">&nbsp;Sometimes, this reflects decision-making by the author of this literature review, as with the comparison of &ldquo;long term&rdquo; (follow-up at 12 months or more) to &ldquo;short term&rdquo; (follow-up at less than 12 months). At other times, this reflects the decisions of the authors of included research items.

They note that, &ldquo;while providing information was not found to directly influence behaviour, future research should explore whether this approach might contribute towards reducing population-wide demand for meat in other ways.
