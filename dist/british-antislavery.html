specifically, human chattel slavery &mdash; was not a new phenomenon in the time of the transatlantic Slave trade, which started in the early 16th century and lasted through the mid-19th century. It had long been perceived as normal, natural, and necessary, and historian Robert Fogel says it &ldquo;stood above criticism for 3,000 years.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt1" id="ftnt_ref1">[1]</a></sup><span class="c2">&nbsp;Antislavery was one of the first movements to take off and to succeed in the modern push for social justice, and its history is well-documented. This makes the British antislavery movement, which preceded and ignited successful antislavery movements throughout the world, a remarkable case study for modern advocates.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c9"><span>This report provides a condensed history of the British antislavery movement, charting a course from its roots through the ban on the transatlantic Slave trade and culminating in the ban on human chattel slavery in the British empire. Unless otherwise specified, this report uses the term </span><span class="c18">abolition</span><span>&nbsp;to refer to the legal ban on the transatlantic Slave trade and </span><span class="c18">emancipation</span><span>&nbsp;to refer to the legal ban on human chattel slavery.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt2" id="ftnt_ref2">[2]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;It uses </span><span class="c18">antislavery </span><span>to refer to the movement or advocates who worked on both or either effort; </span><span class="c18">Slavery</span><span>, capitalized, to refer to the chattel enslavement of Africans and their descendants, as well as some Native Americans, by Europeans and their descendants; </span><span class="c18">Slaves</span><span>, capitalized, to refer to those slaves; and </span><span class="c18">the (transatlantic) Slave trade</span><span>&nbsp;to refer to the trade in human slaves from Africa to the Americas. After providing this history, the report will draw conclusions about which strategies seemed to be most effective for the movement and propose tentative implications for the movement against animal farming.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c9"><span>Studying successful movements of the past can provide invaluable insights into the most effective strategies for modern movements. The two institutions of the European enslavement of Africans and their descendants in the Americas and the modern farming of nonhuman animals share the fundamental characteristic of </span><span class="c18">commodification</span><span class="c2">: They treated/treat sentient beings as property, rather than as individuals who had/have their own interests. Both movements also relied/rely on discrimination based on group membership &mdash; in Slavery, race, and in animal farming, species. The focus of this report is on strategic insights for the movement against animal farming, but we will discuss some insights for the broader animal rights movement, and these insights may be useful for other movements as well.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c9"><span>Historically, many people have compared Slavery and various forms of nonhuman commodification in rough, oversimplified, and sometimes even vindictive ways without considering the impact of that comparison on one or both oppressed populations.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt3" id="ftnt_ref3">[3]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;While the comparison is typically made in an attempt to elevate nonhumans, it often has the effect of degrading black people, because broader society regards nonhuman animals as fundamentally inferior to humans. Simplistic comparisons can also fail to appreciate how racist oppression is historically predicated on speciesist oppression &mdash; the history of Slavery, for instance, is replete with assertions that black humans are as inferior to white men as nonhuman animals, and such dehumanization, however unfair to the nonhumans whose moral insignificance was silently assumed, has probably had lasting impacts on people of color and may still directly contribute to racism in society.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt4" id="ftnt_ref4">[4]</a></sup><span class="c2">&nbsp;As such, crude comparisons of the similarities between each groups&rsquo; subjugation can alienate people with genetic ancestry or cultural heritage in Slavery and may subtly reinforce racism, especially when the person making the comparison is white. In addition, the comparison may even backfire and perpetuate the speciesism that people of many races have worked to distance themselves from.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c2">This context means advocates should take care not to reduce the lived experiences of individuals in either group to their common denominator with the lived experiences of those in the other, erasing the circumstances and experiences that are unique to each of them and ignoring the contextual relationship between racism and speciesism, which has a long history of simultaneously degrading both nonhuman animals and people of color alike.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c9"><span>The fundamental comparison this report hinges on is that the individuals of both groups were/are sentient individuals who faced/face discrimination and were/are treated as chattel. Our purpose is to analyze and compare the </span><span class="c18">movement</span><span>&nbsp;for the welfare and liberation of commodified Africans &mdash; and their hereditarily commodified descendants &mdash; who were used for labor in the New World with that of commodified animals who are used in the food industry in order to assess the strategic implications the latter can draw from the former.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c9"><span>Of course, no historical document is</span><span>&nbsp;perfectly comprehensive, </span><span>and some important details may be missing from the varied histories used to compile this report. There is also significant disagreement and </span><span>debate</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;among historians about the nature and importance of some circumstances and events, such as the economic value of the transatlantic Slave trade. The interpretation of necessarily incomplete historical information is imperfect and inevitably warps the truth of what happened to some degree.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c9"><span>To mitigate these issues and craft as comprehensive yet brief and digestible a history as possible, this report relied on a recent and relatively comprehensive book about the movement, called </span><span class="c18">Bury the Chains</span><span>,</span><span>&nbsp;and augmented that history with information from several other long-form histories taking a variety of perspectives, with clarifications and additional information sourced from parliamentary records</span><span>, other contemporary publications, journal publications, and several other resources. This history will venture away from the topic of British antislavery at times, but only insofar as it&rsquo;s useful to understand the strategy and outcomes of British antislavery.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c9"><span>While a handful of significantly less invested nations and American colonies or states achieved abolition and/or emancipation before the UK, the British antislavery movement was the first to launch into the public spotlight. The UK and </span><span>US</span><span>&nbsp;were the first of the handful of major stakeholders in the transatlantic Slave trade to abolish the trade, more or less simultaneously, and the UK compelled other major stakeholding nations including Spain, France and Portugal to abolish the trade after they did. The UK was also the second</span><span>&nbsp;major stakeholder</span><span>&nbsp;in Slavery to permanently emancipate its Slaves, after Spain. Perhaps most importantly, the citizens and Slaves of other nations both knew about the antislavery movement in the UK and were directly influenced by it in some important ways: For instance, William Lloyd Garrison, a major American movement leader, visited the British movement leaders to learn from them, and antislavery advocate and later Member of Parliament (</span><span>MP</span><span>) George Thompson gave a speaking tour in the US shortly after the UK legislated emancipation. This makes the evidence we can obtain from studying abolition and emancipation in other major stakeholding nations who adopted their reforms, abolitions, and emancipations after the UK more tenuous, because it is unclear how relatively important the UK&rsquo;s movement, precedent, and direct influences were to the decisions of the nations who followed suit within a mere generation. The UK was likely in turn affected by the activism, attitudes, and legal changes in other regions with which it exchanged significant flows of people, trade, and information, so further study of other nations&rsquo; movements during and before the time of the British movement is especially valuable.<br><br></span><span>The British antislavery movement also had the particularly interesting feature of a push for improvements to the cruelties of the </span><span class="c2">industry, which advocates pursued both in the near-term interest of Slaves and in the longer-term interest of eliminating the institution.

Victims were/are totally controlled, and that control was/is forcefully obtained.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c9"><span>Both sets of victims seem to have solicited/solicit sufficient levels of empathy to produce substantial public outrage.

White Slave traders also appear to have typically treated the Slaves in their charge with the same total deficit of empathy with which human farmers typically treat the animals in their charge, but if the British public had more empathy for Slaves than the public today has for farmed animals, then we might expect the employees of the Slave trade to have shown greater empathy as well &mdash; and that doesn&rsquo;t appear to be the case. Remember, too, the many instances of black humans being explicitly spoken of as inferior &ldquo;animals&rdquo; and Slaves being spoken of as though they were literally inanimate objects. All of this suggests that our empathy in the contemporary situation, even if potentially weaker, is sufficient for us to have a successful movement against the institution.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c9"><span>Both groups of victims had/have little to no way of communicating with the general public without the help of allies, despite humans being able to do so more easily in theory.

That abolition and emancipation were successfully achieved anyway suggests that farmed animal advocacy could succeed as well despite a heavy reliance on allies. To the extent that this is an impediment, it can probably be mitigated by efforts to emphasize victims&rsquo; voices, for instance through the use of audio and visual recordings of victims&rsquo; nonverbal expressions. However, since allies&rsquo; voices were emphasized in the antislavery movement, it&rsquo;s possible that prioritizing them over victims&rsquo; voices is the best strategy.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c9"><span>Neither population could participate in the politics of their oppressors. While most Slaves who could speak some English had the necessary intrinsic capacities to participate in British politics, farmed animals lack the ability to understand or communicate about human politics.

In fact, far from foregrounding Slaves&rsquo; own struggle for freedom, the most antislavery leaders usually said on the topic of rebellion was to respond to the claim that speaking of abolition or emancipation would incite rebellion by suggesting that those rebellions demonstrated the Slaves&rsquo; desire for freedom. Rebellions appear have made the industry less stable and as such less valuable to the empire, but so too do the disease outbreaks and environmental disasters caused by animal farming.</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;As mentioned earlier, rebellions may have also indicated to Britons the failure of Slavery to &ldquo;civilize&rdquo; and Christianize Slaves, a purported proslavery motivation of unclear importance, but so too does animal farming fail to sustainably feed the world, a purported pro-animal-farming motivation.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c9"><span>Victims lived/live without enough health and safety to prevent a significant portion of them from dying, and were/are often worked to death.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt659" id="ftnt_ref659">[659]</a></sup></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c2">Individuals in either case who were/are free from the institution either since birth or through individual liberation had/have limited protection and were/are at risk of capture, at least if they resided in the Americas or were previously enslaved in the case of victims of Slavery.</span></p><h3 class="c27" id="h.scmxyh8m84tz"><span class="c14">Institution</span></h3><p class="c9"><span>By the time each movement developed societies/organizations opposing the institution, it had been around for all living memory.

Some were considered free and held the basic legal rights of white men of their class, meaning for instance that they could own property and testify, and that killing them was murder and enslaving them illegal. Some regions have granted some rights to a few nonhuman species, but there are no nonhumans animals who have the same rights as a human. Nonhumans are therefore categorically more objectified in law. As they do not as individuals have the possibility of becoming persons like black humans did if they were manumitted, born free, or judged to be free, it may also be harder for society to envision them as persons. People who own nonhuman animals are also referred to as &ldquo;owners&rdquo; &mdash; though some owners of common &ldquo;pet&rdquo; species choose to use the term &ldquo;guardian,&rdquo; though there is no legal distinction &mdash; while people who owned Slaves were referred to as &ldquo;masters,&rdquo; suggesting those Slaves were perceived somewhat more as servants than nonhuman animals.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt677" id="ftnt_ref677">[677]</a></sup></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c2">Individuals in the contemporary nonhuman situation who are manumitted or rescued, or who escape, or who are born in the wild or into a family that does not treat them as property, can essentially only integrate into society to the extremely limited degree that some humans take them into their homes as their property or visit such homes and sanctuaries to interact with them. Ex-Slaves, on the other hand, could work, buy property, and learn European table manners, instruments and languages.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c2">Enslaved black humans were also more closely related to their oppressors than any farmed animals are to theirs. This is the case both in terms of genetic makeup and in terms of humanity&rsquo;s assignment of biological taxonomy. While all victims and oppressors are sentient individuals who also share the same kingdom and phylum, black humans shared the same species as their oppressors, while farmed animals share at closest the same biological class. Because of this greater genetic proximity, Slaves were more similar to their oppressors in appearance and were also easier to communicate with. Given this greater distance, as well as the longer, more widespread, and more pervasive history of nonhuman subjugation, it is possible that prejudice against other species today is stronger than racism was in the time of Slavery.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c9"><span>While both groups of victims were/are laborers, farmed animals are also raw materials. Though enforcement was probably very limited, it was often lawfully considered murder to kill a Slave, at least after 1797.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt678" id="ftnt_ref678">[678]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;In the production of animal meat, killing the animals is currently unavoidable, and while it may not be technically necessary for egg and dairy production, it is economically necessary, so the norm in the industry is to kill all farmed animals.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt679" id="ftnt_ref679">[679]</a></sup><span class="c2">&nbsp;Unlike animal farming, the Slave industry did not have dedicated facilities for killing its victims and rendering them into consumer products. That farmed animals are literally turned into goods suggests that they are more readily regarded as objects than Slaves were, as does their lack of protection for their lives relative to the little, but non-zero, protection Slaves had.</span></p><h3 class="c27" id="h.kemh9x5db4zy"><span class="c14">Institution</span></h3><p class="c9"><span class="c2">The consumer products of the Slave industry were unchanged when production shifted to free labor, but before cellular agriculture or plant-based food technologies can satisfactorily replace animal-based foods, or if they cannot, a ban on animal farming would deprive people of the industry&rsquo;s products.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c7">It seems that what mattered most about Slaves&rsquo; resistance was how economically volatile and physically dangerous it made the institution of Slavery. </span><span>Farmed animals&rsquo; resistance may cause a few human injuries and result in a very small number of individuals lost in efforts to escape, but their resistance does not seem nearly as costly to the industry or society as Slave rebellions in the colonies appear to have been relative to the size of each industry.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt680" id="ftnt_ref680">[680]</a></sup></p><h3 class="c27" id="h.wfs4vku9purp"><span class="c14">Advocacy</span></h3><p class="c9"><span class="c2">While antislavery advocates pioneered many their tactics, and were one of the few charitable organizations lobbying government at the time &mdash; as opposed to religious bodies and trade groups &mdash; today government officials and the public are saturated with many interest groups, many of them using similar advocacy tactics and potentially making it harder for each individual group to have their voice heard.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c2">This greater abundance of advocacy groups may also provide individuals with more opportunities to find purpose and identity in and to rally to other causes that speak to them. Antislavery advocates&rsquo; mobilization of the lower classes was also a novel strategy at the time, so there may have been very limited competition for their purpose and identity. It may also have been very fortunate for antislavery advocates that they started when they did, launching the issue into the public spotlight only a year before the storming of the Bastille and start of the French Revolution, and as such committing people to the cause before republican revolutionary movements started competing for their attention.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c2">Slavery was a luxury of the upper classes, even in terms of the consumption of West Indian goods, and working class white people saw the upper classes as an enemy, particularly in this time of revolution. This shared enemy could have both made them feel more solidarity with Slaves than people today can feel with farmed animals, and made it easier to oppose the institution&rsquo;s financial benefactors since on another level they already did. The animal farming industry may be an enemy to many people who oppose corporate influence over government or the industry&rsquo;s costs to public health, the environment, or the economy, but the public does not perceive the industry as treating them so fundamentally unjustly that they are staging mass revolutions against the industry&rsquo;s stakeholders out of their own interest.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c2">The year before emancipation was finally granted, a planter, a Vice Admiral, the parliamentary undersecretary to the Colonial Office, and a minister all insisted that if the Slaves were not emancipated very soon, the UK was at risk of losing its colonies entirely. While nations that farm animals on large scales today face significant and increasing public health, environmental, and associated economic costs and risks for doing so, those costs and risks are increasing slowly and not likely to get to a similar state of urgency in the near future. That said, over time, given population growth and climate change, eventually those costs should increase to a point where replacing animal agriculture with plant and/or cellular agriculture is regarded widely, if begrudgingly, as the preferable alternative to issues such as widespread food and water shortages, so while the currently lower salience of the risks may mean animal farming is harder to eliminate now, this disadvantage should decrease with time.</span></p><h3 class="c27" id="h.pqo1mlxle2du"><span class="c14">Society</span></h3><p class="c9"><span>In </span><span>the UK</span><span>, though perhaps not in its West Indian colonies, racism may not have been as entrenched as speciesism is now.</span><span>&nbsp;While most humans in Western societies today rarely interact with live farmed animals, the vast majority do interact with their dead bodies several times a day.

People today can envision and have sometimes seen animal farms that either lack or at least appear to lack the blatant cruelty and extensive suffering that happens on factory farms. On the one hand, this greater opportunity to envision a humane institution may mean that people today have a stronger psychological refuge excusing and upholding the institution broadly. In addition to making the project of ending animal farming or even factory farming more difficult, this could mean that reforms, which presumably play into the fantasy of a humane system, pose greater risks of making people more misinformed about and comfortable with the industry. On the other hand, the contrast between factory farms and farms perceived as humane, coupled with the newness of the more cruel industrial system, could make it easier for people to oppose the new system and as such the whole industry which it now dominates.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c9"><span>Before the formation of the Abolition Committee, some planters made</span><span>&nbsp;or recommended efforts to improve Slaves&rsquo; welfare in ways that also improved </span><span>productivity, without the urging of </span><span class="c7">antislavery advocates</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;to do so. It&rsquo;s unclear to what degree corporate commitments to reform animal farming practices to date have directly benefitted profitability or been concessions to advocates, but most reforms have come at the explicit urging of advocates.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c9"><span>Humanewashing is more pervasive in the animal farming</span><span>&nbsp;industry, which for instance runs commercials explicitly expressing their concern for the animals&rsquo; welfare, prolifically employs cartoons of happy farmed animals in marketing efforts, and extensively labels their products in ways that suggest high welfare standards. On the one hand, this may make people believe the industry is more benevolent than it actually is, resulting in less impetus to oppose it</span><span>. O</span><span>n the other hand, since humanewashing messages fundamentally concede that the welfare of their subjects is important, they may encourage people to care more about </span><span class="c8 c7">them</span><span>, resulting in more willingness to act when they are presented with the realities of the industry.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt695" id="ftnt_ref695">[695]</a></sup></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c9"><span>The sugar, coffee, tobacco, and other goods produced by Slaves in the West Indies were consumed less and probably viewed more as luxury goods than products of animal farming in the UK and US are today, as opposed to, for instance, in China, where animal products have long been a luxury, though that is changing with the adoption of industrial animal farming in the region.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt696" id="ftnt_ref696">[696]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;</span><span>This could mean the animal farming industry has more power despite what appears to be less economic significance.</span><span>&nbsp;However, since the American Dietetic Association considers animal products inessential,</span><sup><a href="#ftnt697" id="ftnt_ref697">[697]</a></sup><span class="c2">&nbsp;advocacy may be able to diminish the notion that animal products are necessary rather than luxury goods, even if at present many people treat them as staples and even if they are currently more accessible to some people than alternative sources of adequate nutrition.</span></p><h3 class="c27" id="h.urz8tweolcl1"><span class="c14">Advocacy</span></h3><p class="c9"><span class="c2">Antislavery advocates&rsquo; tactics were generally novel, which could have been to their advantage, but advocates using those same tactics today have nearly two centuries of trials proving their effectiveness.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c9"><span>Modern communications technologies enable modern advocates to</span><span>&nbsp;share information and messages far more easily and more widely than antislavery advocates could.

For example: employer-employee relationships were based on traditional master-servant relationships, and allowed severe punishment</span><sup><a href="#ftnt700" id="ftnt_ref700">[700]</a></sup><span>; laborers in new industrial cities had virtually none of the labor rights we do now; indentured servitude was common; people could be drafted into the navy with more force, less warning, and less ability to abstain than they have today; crew in the </span><span>transatlantic Slave trade</span><span>&nbsp;faced significant violence and other injustice the likes of which are now entirely illegal and almost unheard of in high-income Western nations; and punishments for petty crimes were far more severe. That today&rsquo;s society is less cruel may indicate that we have a greater general concern for others&rsquo; wellbeing, but may also indicate merely greater concern for humans&rsquo; wellbeing and not extend to concern for nonhuman animals. That the vast majority of humans in the West face significantly less cruelty and injustice than they did at the time of Slavery may also mean people have greater opportunity to care for others, their own oppression lessened and their needs more met, but may alternatively mean they are less able to empathize with individuals experiencing severe oppression and suffering and as such that they feel less motivation to help them.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c9"><span>Owning Slaves was a status symbol, something the wealthy enjoyed and the less wealthy aspired to,</span><sup><a href="#ftnt701" id="ftnt_ref701">[701]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;whereas neither farming nor eating </span><span class="c8 c7">nonhuman </span><span>animals is a symbol of wealth in </span><span>most of the West</span><span class="c2">, excepting to some degree among some recent immigrants to the West and in regions with more recently industrialized economies. While some animal-based foods are associated with wealth, like lobster, caviar, and steak, those comprise a very small part of the animal farming industry and also seem less important to younger generations than they did to previous generations as status symbols. While the widespread use of animal products and lack of the prestige associated with owning Slaves may mean people are less personally invested in animal farming, it has also enabled more people in the oppressing group to participate in the oppression, as the vast majority are.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c2">Today&rsquo;s capitalist economies are much more consumer-oriented &mdash; more advertisements, more product labels, more brands, and more consumption &mdash; which could suggest that consumer action is more impactful today, but could also make it easy for people to dismiss consumer-focused movements as being merely matters of consumer preference and no more important or politically serious than other consumer trends. Either way, this applies both to campaigns for individual consumer change &mdash; e.g. veganism, vegetarianism, reducetarianism &mdash; and to campaigns pressuring corporations to change their practices.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c2">Since people today are inundated with advertisements and other provocative images and video, today&rsquo;s advocacy groups are under pressure to use these or risk being unseen and/or regarded as abnormal. This means for instance that groups who campaign for reforms cannot just talk about reforms but have to show images, for instance of animals in their current circumstances like a battery cage, in the circumstances the reform would take their successors to like a cage-free barn, or in ideal circumstances like a sanctuary. This allows advocates to share more information with their audience than text alone, but it also generally compels them to make a choice between putting their audience off with unpleasant realistic images or contributing to misperceptions about farmed animals&rsquo; circumstances by using unrealistically pleasant images. One alternative that may avoid both downsides is images that focus on living animals&rsquo; faces and leave their circumstances ambiguous.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c9"><span>Today&rsquo;s Western governments are dramatically more represent</span><span>ative.

That the elected House of Commons was more supportive of abolition and emancipation than the appointed and more elite House of Lords and that electoral expansion increased the number of emancipation supporters in Parliament suggests that greater representation in government is an advantage, but elections for the Commons were still far less representative so this is a tenuous suggestion.</span></p><h1 class="c25" id="h.vcyrdborlj74"><span>Strategic Implications</span></h1><p class="c9"><span>As noted in the &ldquo;Summary of Key Implications,&rdquo; there are many challenges in integrating evidence from historical social movements into modern advocacy decision-making.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt703" id="ftnt_ref703">[703]</a></sup><span class="c2">&nbsp;This section lists a number of strategic claims supported by the evidence in this report.

However, if a major political campaign to abolish factory farming, slaughterhouses, or animal farming started and consumer abstinence were encouraged as an act of political support rather than as an end goal, that number would probably increase. Keep in mind that before there was a campaign for abolition in Great Britain, presumably virtually no one was boycotting sugar, so current rates of vegetarianism may suggest greater support for anti-animal-farming advocacy than antislavery advocates initially had.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2 c7"></span></p><p class="c9"><span>&bull; </span><span class="c15">People can support a ban on the institution even if they do not understand or oppose the prejudice that enables it; even if they harbor that prejudice to a significant degree themselves; and even if they personally participate in the industry.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c9"><span>Antislavery advocates discussed racism little and almost universally avoided discussing racial equality.

It does appear, however, that the economic harm to the West Indian sugar trade was not sustained and the boycott at its peaks only ever reached around 4-6% of the population and reduced sugar sales by &#8531; to &frac12;. Its primary participants were probably usually not spending time on it that they could have put into political advocacy instead, as they were not able to participate in politics. The boycott may simply have been among the best actions women at the time were able to take.<br><br>The nature of this seemingly successful consumer campaign seems to be quite different from the modern anti-animal-farming advocacy focus on individual consumer change. The sugar boycott didn&rsquo;t displace much if any political activism; it was brief; it was specific to the top West Indian export, sugar, rather than to all Slave-made goods; it was seen as a tool in advocates&rsquo; diverse toolbelt, not as the central goal of the movement; and it was able to do significant economic damage to the target industry, cutting off up to &frac12; of sugar sales at one point because it was a luxury good with concentrated consumption among the wealthy.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c2">A better comparison for anti-animal-farming advocates&rsquo; approach to consumer action is the American &ldquo;free produce&rdquo; movement and the abstinence from Slave-made goods among some Quakers and a rare few other individuals. Though the failure of Quaker abstinence may have had more to do with their limited influence in society than with the strategy itself, American advocates&rsquo; efforts to convince consumers to abstain from purchasing the products of the target industry were considered relatively ineffective by the advocates themselves after two decades of limited success.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c2">Ultimately, the British, American, and other antislavery movements found success when they focused their resources almost entirely on political goals to restrict, reform, and eventually eliminate the institution. This suggests that anti-animal-farming advocates should focus less on changing consumer behavior and more on a political movement to restrict, reform, and eliminate the institution.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c2">Some &ldquo;Differences&rdquo; discussed earlier could be reasons anti-animal-farming advocates might find more success with consumer campaigns than antislavery advocates did. For instance, the average Western consumer today has a closer connection to the institution in question through their consumption of animals and clearly animal-based foods several times a day. All things considered, the strategy and outcomes of the British antislavery movement seem like relatively strong evidence against an emphasis on consumer change.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c15">&bull; If advocating for consumer action, focus on a specific symbol of the problem and clearly contextualize the action as supporting the political campaign.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c2">While a few people made an effort to abstain from purchasing any Slave-made goods, the consumer movement supporting abolition focused specifically on West Indian sugar. This avoidance of one major symbol of the institution gained substantially more traction than the avoidance of all the institution&rsquo;s products.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c2">This suggests that in consumer advocacy used to support the political movement anti-animal-farming advocates should focus on convincing people to specifically stop eating animals, rather than to go vegan, which is a stronger ask, or to reduce their consumption of all animal products across the board, which does not offer as clear a symbol and meme.</span></p><h3 class="c27" id="h.ppnk2s5h4f8e"><span class="c14">Institutional Reform</span></h3><p class="c9"><span class="c21">&bull; </span><span class="c7 c21">Run a major legislative campaign that is more agreeable to the public than eliminating the whole industry, but which will still significantly curtail it.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c9"><span>Antislavery advocates first focused on and achieved the abolition of the </span><span>transatlantic Slave trade</span><span>&nbsp;(1787-1807), then after a lull in activity briefly worked on several moderate welfare reforms in the explicit interest of gradual emancipation (1823-1824), then seeing those fail to help the Slaves quickly shifted focus to and achieved emancipation (women started driving immediate emancipationism in 1826</span><span>, young advocates took it up in 1830, and emancipation with a four-year deadline was achieved in 1833)</span><span class="c2">. This suggests that at this stage anti-animal-farming advocates should deprioritize minor and moderate welfare reforms and focus on specific major reforms.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c9"><span>The question is what constitutes a large reform, on par with the ban on the </span><span>transatlantic Slave trade</span><span>. </span><span class="c7">W</span><span class="c7">hereas the supply of Slaves in the colonies relied partly on the trade and partly on the reproduction of Slaves &mdash; &ldquo;natural&rdquo; or compelled &mdash; animal farming relies virtually entirely on reproduction, so a trade ban is likely not an appropriate analogy.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c9"><span>To match the ban on the </span><span>transatlantic Slave trade</span><span class="c2">, an ideal major reform would be specific, highly agreeable to the public, and a very large but not immediately damning cost to the industry.

One possibility that could encompass fish and chickens raised for meat &mdash; who constitute the vast majority of farmed animals</span><sup><a href="#ftnt710" id="ftnt_ref710">[710]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;&mdash; is a minimum space requirement relative to body size for all farmed animals, at a size that strikes a balance between being so small that it&rsquo;s hard to oppose and so large that it will cost the industry substantially. Other potentially suitable reforms may include size limits for slaughterhouses, bans on the construction of new slaughterhouses, or size limits for animal farms that would eliminate &ldquo;large&rdquo; Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs)</span><sup><a href="#ftnt711" id="ftnt_ref711">[711]</a></sup><span class="c2">&nbsp;and large fish farms.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c9"><span>A ban on all CAFOs would presumably be significantly bigger hit to the industry than the </span><span>transatlantic Slave trade</span><span>&nbsp;ban was to Slavery because, by the Environmental Protection Agency&rsquo;s standards, CAFOs in the US represent roughly 50-67% of farmed cows, 96-98% of farmed pigs, and 99% of farmed birds, and presumably all farmed fish,</span><sup><a href="#ftnt712" id="ftnt_ref712">[712]</a></sup><span class="c2">&nbsp;but this may make it harder to achieve.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c9"><span>It&rsquo;s possible that a key feature of the ban on the </span><span>transatlantic Slave trade</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;was that it directly eliminated a limb of the industry, rather than reduce its size or severity across the board. This could for instance make a ban on cages or egg farming superior to legislation that does as much damage to the industry directly but is seen more as an improvement than a removal or ban. Improvements can probably generally be be expressed as a kind of ban &mdash; for instance a maximum population density could be expressed as a ban on overcrowding, or daily outdoor access for all animals as a ban on indoor confinement &mdash; but advocates only have so much control over media presentation so this is not a full mitigation of the difference.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c9"><span>A ban on slaughterhouses &mdash; but not necessarily slaughter itself &mdash; may meet the Slave trade criteria.

The latter seems relatively unimportant to the question at hand today, and while the US may have a barrier of state autonomy, US states themselves do not, nor do the UK or other Western nations. If the Committee was accurate in their belief that those legal circumstances were major barriers, advocates may be in a better position today to campaign for more radical intervention, like a ban on CAFOs or the whole animal farming industry.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c21 c7">&bull; </span><span class="c15 c7">Focus resources on pushing for that major reform and then for the elimination of the institution.

As discussed, this seems to have been important to the tide of impatience that secured emancipation.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2 c7"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c7">Presently, many efforts to reform animal farming rely on corporate commitments, which for the most part have a deadline years in the future, so assessing their compliance is challenging. However, federal regulations, even though currently extremely limited, are often evaded and violated and the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) has acknowledged that they cannot enforce them well.</span><sup class="c7"><a href="#ftnt713" id="ftnt_ref713">[713]</a></sup><span class="c2 c7">&nbsp;Animal industries also successfully lobbied for the Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act and the animal farming industry has successfully lobbied for several state &ldquo;ag-gag&rdquo; laws to hide what they are doing from the public. This inability &mdash; and overt refusal &mdash; to reform should be more widely publicized as a reason that the industry cannot be trusted to treat animals well and as such should be eliminated.

Like many </span><span>anti-animal-farming</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;advocates today, the Abolition Committee worried that the first reform of the trade would reduce momentum against it, but the abolition campaign did not slow down, nor does the reform appear to have been cited as a reason that the trade was sufficiently benevolent. After abolition, it took only a decade for emancipation to win after a suite of reforms to Slavery was imposed on the West Indian colonies.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c9"><span>It may be very important, however, that the context of these reforms differed significantly from the context of current reforms to animal farms. Abolition was already explicitly in the public spotlight at the time of the first reform</span><span>, and though abolitionists rarely mentioned their end goal of emancipation before they achieved abolition, the goal appears to have been widely understood. By the later reforms, abolition had long since been achieved, and the goal of emancipation, if a smooth and gradual one, was expressed explicitly.</span><span>&nbsp;The later reforms may also have been important specifically because the industry, even after weakening the measures, failed to enforce them, which seemed to shift moderates to support a hard deadline for emancipation.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c9"><span>Presently, it does not appear that ending animal farming, any time soon at least, is a real possibility in the public&rsquo;s mind. Even the abolition of factory farming is not currently a major political issue, so reforms are probably easy to interpret as end goals. Farmed animal advocates&rsquo; asks as well as media coverage of investigations and reforms typically either offers a consumer-oriented solution of buying better, fewer, or no animal-based foods, or focus on a particular reform in isolation. That antislavery advocates had such different context for their reforms suggests that anti-animal-farming advocates should adopt the corresponding context, and that reform advocacy may pose greater risks of inducing complacency without that context of a bigger goal.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c9"><span>Antislavery advocates also do not appear to have presented</span><span>&nbsp;any mitigation of cruelty and suffering as an end to it</span><span>, as farmed animal advocates often do</span><span>. Citizens for Farm Animal Protection, for instance, which campaigned for the 2016 Massachusetts state bill to ban the production and sale of animal products that used battery cages, veal crates, or gestation crates, showed images of healthy animals in sunny, picturesque fields, and their logo said &ldquo;Prevent Animal Cruelty.&rdquo; A similar campaign just started in California, with similar images and messaging, including a video showing the words &ldquo;Want to end animal cruelty?&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt714" id="ftnt_ref714">[714]</a></sup><span class="c2">&nbsp;While attractive, such messaging could mislead consumers into thinking these bill will end all cruelty on the animal farms in their reach and ensure the animals are raised in good health in spacious sunny pastures, which is a far cry from their actual impact. Antislavery advocates, on the other hand, presented the reforms they had a hand in as the compromises they were, and were clear that their goal was a gradual transition to emancipation.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c9"><span>Relatedly, since the major value of Slaves&rsquo; resistance seems to have been the economic cost it incurred on the industry, but farmed animals cannot comparably rebel, small reforms that raise costs for the animal farming industry may be advocates&rsquo; best analogue.</span></p><h3 class="c27" id="h.fryv2463paxb"><span class="c14">Indirect Strategy</span></h3><p class="c9"><span class="c15">&bull; If moral advocacy seems insufficient, look for ways to significantly reduce the size of the industry through indirect means.<br></span></p><p class="c9"><span>The Foreign Slave Trade Act may have substantially reduced the British </span><span>transatlantic Slave trade</span><span class="c2">, though this motive of the impact on the trade was downplayed. The bill, which ratified and expanded a decree Prime Minister Pitt had made several months earlier, was pushed through as a wartime measure meant to impede the UK&rsquo;s enemies. Both its actual and perceived impacts on the trade are unclear, however, as the trade was sufficiently volatile that the decline in the trade in the year following the act could have been normal variation.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c9"><span>For anti-animal-farming advocates, this could suggest working on bills regarding environmental, public health, consumer safety, and labor issues in the industry, which would have the effect of reducing its scale.

Antislavery&rsquo;s most supportive white populations appear to have been Quakers, Methodists, Baptists, women, working class men, and the Irish, who all experienced persecution and prejudice from the wealthy Anglican English men who ran Parliament.

At this time, the Commons became substantially more supportive of abolition than they had been the last time a motion for it was made in 1799 or any year prior, and they passed immediate abolition for the first time that year.

The same former Slave and another also published letters in London newspapers about Slavery, and a </span><span>renowned preacher and hymn writer</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;published a pamphlet opposing Slavery which was immediately popular.

One kind of exceptional event </span><span>anti-animal-farming</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;advocates can try to elevate to a triggering event is when local news media covers a totalled truck that was carrying chickens to slaughter or a cow who escaped a slaughterhouse. Advocates can organize rescues of those animals to demonstrate an alternative for farmed animals&rsquo; fates and write op-eds publicizing the incident and tying it to the broader problem of animal farming. Advocates can similarly amplify, for instance, media attention on disease </span><span>outbreaks and environmental disasters that are traceable to animal farming or </span><span class="c2 c7">lawsuits about misleading labelling on the industry&rsquo;s products.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2 c7"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c15">&bull; Once the movement is in the public spotlight, publicize situations where the industry treats movement supporters from the oppressing group horribly, to make them martyrs.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c2 c7">When emancipationism started gaining steam, after abolition, Britons were outraged when missionaries were violently attacked and in one case effectively killed by planters who blamed them for Slave revolts.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2 c7"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c2 c7">If someone else is prosecuted under the Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act, or faces consequences for violating an ag-gag law that the public would agree are excessive, or if an investigation determines that an advocate has been slandered or physically attacked at the hands of the industry, or when the industry tries to illegally, maliciously, or hypocritically undercut plant-based competitors, that should be publicized widely.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2 c7"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c15 c7">&bull; Do due diligence before making investments, and cut losses on bad investments.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2 c7"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c7">The Sierra Leone company failed repeatedly and wasted a substantial amount of movement resources.

It is unclear to what degree knowledge of Slave revolts and their suppression made the public more or less concerned for Slaves or more or less supportive of abolition and emancipation, though a deeper analysis of press around revolts may shed some light on this.</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;</span><span class="c7">At any rate, abolition and emancipation seem to have passed with virtually no public expression of support of Slaves&rsquo; resistance, even from leading </span><span class="c2 c7">antislavery advocates.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2 c7"></span></p><p class="c9"><span>However, that today&rsquo;s cultural context emphasizes social justice and lauds rebellions society considers just may favor greater emphasis on victims&rsquo; </span><span class="c2">resistance and agency. Additionally, nonhumans will not be integrated into human society like freed human slaves were &mdash; ideally they will merely stop coming into existence &mdash; so the risk that they will look uncivilized and too dangerous to integrate into society is probably less important.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c21">&bull; </span><span class="c21 c7">Work on enforcement following reforms?</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2 c7"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c2 c7">If the industry fails to comply with reform legislation on its own, and it resists enforcement, that could powerfully demonstrate that it cannot be trusted to treat the animals well. However, if enforcement is successful, while that could weaken the industry, it could also make people trust that the industry can and will treat the animals well.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2 c7"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c21">&bull; </span><span class="c21 c7">Build coalitions with other movements?</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c15 c7"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c2 c7">While antislavery drew substantial support from supporters of other movements, it was generally not explicitly tied to other causes &mdash; including the cause of the poor or impressed white sailors who were treated poorly in the industry &mdash; but advocated for on its own. Clarkson even distanced himself from the French revolutionaries he supported for fear that his involvement with them would harm his abolitionist campaigning.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2 c7"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c2 c7">However, animal farming is of greater concern for movements that don&rsquo;t care primarily about the institution&rsquo;s direct victims, nonhuman or human, such as the movements for climate protection, resource sustainability, and public health. Coalitions come with risks of alienating supporters who agree with the aims of one&rsquo;s own group but not with the aims of another, but this may be of limited concern if a coalition focuses on a specific shared goal and not on tying the entire movements together.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2 c7"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c2 c7">This may mean anti-animal-farming campaigns should build coalitions among groups who share or can be influenced to share a primary goal of ending animal farming, but that farmed animal advocacy organizations in general should not build broad alliances with other movements.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2 c7"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c7">That today&rsquo;s society has broader concern for discrimination, however, suggests that the risks of openly associating with other discrimination-focused movements are limited and even that such association may be beneficial, at least to the extent that those movements are popularly supported.</span></p><h1 class="c25" id="h.itqhoq5fzjgq"><span class="c16">Potential Items for Further Study</span></h1><p class="c9"><span>H</span><span>ow did the actual and perceived economic value to the British empire of the </span><span>transatlantic Slave trade</span><span>&nbsp;and of Slavery change over time?

The events and circumstances leading to emancipation in some American colonies and later US states and then in the whole of the US North are of particular interest as they happened before the UK even abolished the trade. The US also legislated their international ban on the trade essentially simultaneously with the UK, though this may mean little as US Slave populations were not only self-sustaining but increasing, in contrast with the Slaves of the British West Indies whose mortality rates outpaced their fertility. Spain&rsquo;s emancipation is of similar interest as it happened before British emancipation, though both regions seem to have faced enforcement issues.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c2">How did abolition and emancipation come about in other Western nations?</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c2">What tactics have succeeded and failed in non-Western movements against human slavery, and what implications does this have for non-Western animal advocacy movements?</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c2">What were social movements like prior to the modern era of republicanism and human rights?

Dirty water and unsanitary conditions led to outbreaks of typhoid and dysentery. Rats, lice, and cockroaches spread diseases like typhus. In the Caribbean and other tropical regions, malaria and yellow fever devastated already sickly crews. During the American Revolutionary War, 18,500 of the British navy&#39;s seamen died of disease, compared to only 1,240 killed in action&hellip; The mortality rate on ships in West Indian naval campaigns could approach 50 percent from disease alone. Sailors and officers alike considered service in the Caribbean to be suicidal or, in the case of impressment, a death sentence&hellip; The Royal Navy&#39;s overall desertion rate hovered around 7 percent for most wars between 1689 and 1815, with occasional spikes above 10 percent such as during the American Revolutionary War... The threat alone of flogging, starting, gagging, ducking, standing spread-eagle, wearing the wooden collar, carrying the capstan bar, and running the gauntlet could scare potentially rebellious sailors into performing their jobs without incident.&quot; Denver Brunsman, </span><span class="c4">The Evil Necessity: British Naval Impressment in the Eighteenth-Century Atlantic World</span><span class="c10">&nbsp;(Charlottesville: The University of Virginia Press, 2013).</span></p></div><div><p class="c0"><a href="#ftnt_ref122" id="ftnt122">[122]</a><span class="c10">&nbsp;Hochschild, </span><span class="c4">Bury the Chains</span><span class="c3">, 223.</span></p></div><div><p class="c0"><a href="#ftnt_ref123" id="ftnt123">[123]</a><span class="c3">&nbsp;Ibid., 224.</span></p></div><div><p class="c0"><a href="#ftnt_ref124" id="ftnt124">[124]</a><span class="c3">&nbsp;Powell, 248.</span></p></div><div><p class="c0"><a href="#ftnt_ref125" id="ftnt125">[125]</a><span class="c3">&nbsp;Spence, 42.</span></p></div><div><p class="c0"><a href="#ftnt_ref126" id="ftnt126">[126]</a><span class="c3">&nbsp;Ibid., 43.</span></p></div><div><p class="c0"><a href="#ftnt_ref127" id="ftnt127">[127]</a><span class="c3">&nbsp;Ibid., 46.</span></p></div><div><p class="c0"><a href="#ftnt_ref128" id="ftnt128">[128]</a><span class="c3">&nbsp;Ibid., 43.</span></p></div><div><p class="c0"><a href="#ftnt_ref129" id="ftnt129">[129]</a><span class="c3">&nbsp;Ibid., 47.</span></p></div><div><p class="c0"><a href="#ftnt_ref130" id="ftnt130">[130]</a><span class="c10">&nbsp;Fogel, </span><span class="c4">Without Consent or Contract</span><span class="c3">, 206.</span></p></div><div><p class="c0"><a href="#ftnt_ref131" id="ftnt131">[131]</a><span class="c3">&nbsp;Powell, 248.</span></p></div><div><p class="c0"><a href="#ftnt_ref132" id="ftnt132">[132]</a><span class="c3">&nbsp;Mtubani, 73.</span></p></div><div><p class="c0"><a href="#ftnt_ref133" id="ftnt133">[133]</a><span class="c10">&nbsp;James Walvin, </span><span class="c4">The Zong: A Massacre, the Law and the End of Slavery</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;(New Haven: Yale University Press, 2011), 169.</span></p></div><div><p class="c0"><a href="#ftnt_ref134" id="ftnt134">[134]</a><span class="c10">&nbsp;Fogel, </span><span class="c4">Without Consent or Contract</span><span class="c3">, 206.</span></p></div><div><p class="c0"><a href="#ftnt_ref135" id="ftnt135">[135]</a><span class="c10">&nbsp;Goveia, </span><span class="c4">The West Indian Slave Laws of the Eighteenth Century</span><span class="c3">, 88.</span></p></div><div><p class="c0"><a href="#ftnt_ref136" id="ftnt136">[136]</a><span class="c10">&nbsp;Richard M.

But he wished his reform to be patronised and carried into effect by the legislatures of the West Indies. The consequence was, that all his exertions were ineffectual; and that though his application was enforced by the most powerful of all pleas, viz. that, if they did not reform the system themselves, the British parliament would infallibly pass the much-dreaded abolition law, yet even with this enforcement, the colonial assemblies would do nothing.&rdquo; See col. </span><span class="c1"><a class="c12" href="http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1823/may/15/abolition-of-slavery#column_293">293</a></span><span class="c10">.</span></p></div><div><p class="c0"><a href="#ftnt_ref474" id="ftnt474">[474]</a><span class="c10">&nbsp;Ibid., col. </span><span class="c1"><a class="c12" href="http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1823/may/15/abolition-of-slavery#column_266">266</a></span><span class="c10">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c1"><a class="c12" href="http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1823/may/15/abolition-of-slavery#column_273">273</a></span><span class="c3">.</span></p></div><div><p class="c0"><a href="#ftnt_ref475" id="ftnt475">[475]</a><span class="c10">&nbsp;Ibid., col. </span><span class="c1"><a class="c12" href="http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1823/may/15/abolition-of-slavery#column_285">285</a></span><span class="c10">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c1"><a class="c12" href="http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1823/may/15/abolition-of-slavery#column_360">360</a></span><span class="c3">.</span></p></div><div><p class="c0"><a href="#ftnt_ref476" id="ftnt476">[476]</a><span class="c10">&nbsp;Ibid., col. </span><span class="c1"><a class="c12" href="http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1823/may/15/abolition-of-slavery#column_273">273</a></span><span class="c3">.</span></p></div><div><p class="c0"><a href="#ftnt_ref477" id="ftnt477">[477]</a><span class="c10">&nbsp;Hochschild, </span><span class="c4">Bury the Chains</span><span class="c3">, 324.</span></p></div><div><p class="c0"><a href="#ftnt_ref478" id="ftnt478">[478]</a><span class="c3">&nbsp;Spence, 197.</span></p></div><div><p class="c0"><a href="#ftnt_ref479" id="ftnt479">[479]</a><span class="c10">&nbsp;Hochschild, </span><span class="c4">Bury the Chains</span><span class="c3">, 328.</span></p></div><div><p class="c0"><a href="#ftnt_ref480" id="ftnt480">[480]</a><span class="c3">&nbsp;Ibid., 338.</span></p></div><div><p class="c0"><a href="#ftnt_ref481" id="ftnt481">[481]</a><span class="c3">&nbsp;Ibid., 329.</span></p></div><div><p class="c0"><a href="#ftnt_ref482" id="ftnt482">[482]</a><span class="c3">&nbsp;Ibid., 229.</span></p></div><div><p class="c0"><a href="#ftnt_ref483" id="ftnt483">[483]</a><span class="c3">&nbsp;Ibid., 329.</span></p></div><div><p class="c0"><a href="#ftnt_ref484" id="ftnt484">[484]</a><span class="c3">&nbsp;Ibid., 330-331.</span></p></div><div><p class="c0"><a href="#ftnt_ref485" id="ftnt485">[485]</a><span class="c3">&nbsp;Spence, 194.</span></p></div><div><p class="c0"><a href="#ftnt_ref486" id="ftnt486">[486]</a><span class="c3">&nbsp;Ibid., 195.</span></p></div><div><p class="c0"><a href="#ftnt_ref487" id="ftnt487">[487]</a><span class="c10">&nbsp;&ldquo;La abolici&oacute;n de la esclavitud en Chile,&rdquo; </span><span class="c4">Archivo Nacional de Chile</span><span class="c10">, accessed November 28, 2017, </span><span class="c1"><a class="c12" href="http://www.archivonacional.cl/616/w3-article-8084.html">http://www.archivonacional.cl/616/w3-article-8084.html</a></span><span class="c3">.</span></p></div><div><p class="c0"><a href="#ftnt_ref488" id="ftnt488">[488]</a><span class="c10">&nbsp;Fogel, </span><span class="c4">Without Consent or Contract</span><span class="c3">, 207.</span></p></div><div><p class="c0"><a href="#ftnt_ref489" id="ftnt489">[489]</a><span class="c10">&nbsp;&quot;Combination Acts,&quot; </span><span class="c4">Encyclopedia.com</span><span class="c10">, November 28, 2017, </span><span class="c1"><a class="c12" href="http://www.encyclopedia.com/history/modern-europe/british-and-irish-history/combination-acts">http://www.encyclopedia.com/history/modern-europe/british-and-irish-history/combination-acts</a></span><span class="c3">.</span></p></div><div><p class="c0"><a href="#ftnt_ref490" id="ftnt490">[490]</a><span class="c10">&nbsp;Hochschild, </span><span class="c4">Bury the Chains</span><span class="c3">, 324.</span></p></div><div><p class="c0"><a href="#ftnt_ref491" id="ftnt491">[491]</a><span class="c10">&nbsp;HC Deb.

Slave ship crew were recruited as naive young men enticed with promises of riches and women, and given excess liquor until they could be convinced, or were compelled to overspend at the pub just before the Slave ships left port, compelling them to join a crew to pay their debts &mdash; or they were simply poor and that was the only work available.
