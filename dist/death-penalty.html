Its advocates therefore support, at least in part, an expansion of the moral circle to encompass convicted criminals, in the sense that they would share the right-to-life of non-convicts. Although there are important differences between the ADPM and farmed animal movement, there is a fundamental similarity between them: Advocates from both movements believe that the sentient beings they seek to protect are granted insufficient consideration, protection, or rights and that it is worth investing time and resources into securing more consideration, protection, or rights for them. Other features that affect the ADPM&rsquo;s comparability with the farmed animal movement are listed </span><span class="c18"><a class="c16" href="#h.2bn6wsx">below</a></span><span>, but overall it seems that we can glean some strategic insight from the ADPM suitable for effective animal advocacy&mdash;that is, </span><span class="c34">evidence on which animal advocacy strategies are most effective</span><span>.</span><sup class="c2"><a href="#ftnt1" id="ftnt_ref1">[1]</a></sup></p><p class="c9 c6"><span class="c4 c7 c5"></span></p><p class="c9"><span>As with Sentience Institute&rsquo;s case study of the US anti-abortion movement, </span><span class="c3">this report makes no attempt to evaluate the goals of either movement. This report is exclusively about the strategy of social movements, and while we will discuss goals insofar as they are relevant to strategic discussion, we deliberately avoid any moral assessment.</span><sup class="c2"><a href="#ftnt2" id="ftnt_ref2">[2]</a></sup></p><p class="c9 c6"><span class="c4 c7 c5"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4 c7 c5">This report provides a condensed history of the US ADPM with a focus on the 1960s to the present. For comparison, ADPMs in other countries are also considered briefly. After providing this history, the report draws tentative conclusions about which strategies seemed to be most effective for the ADPM and suggests potential implications for social movement strategy. The focus of this report is on strategic insights for the farmed animal movement, but some insights may be useful for other movements as well.</span></p><p class="c9 c6"><span class="c4 c7 c5"></span></p><p class="c9"><span>The focus on the US ADPM, rather than on ADPMs in other countries or the broader US prisoners&rsquo; rights movement (which includes other goals of prisoner benefit, e.g. better living conditions), was principally due to the greater availability of research and evidence from sociologists, legal scholars, historians, and political scientists. However, compared to the US focus of SI&rsquo;s case study of the anti-abortion movement,</span><sup class="c2"><a href="#ftnt3" id="ftnt_ref3">[3]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;it seemed especially worthwhile to incorporate at least some international comparison on the US ADPM, given that the US has retained the death penalty while 105 other countries have abolished its use.</span><sup class="c2"><a href="#ftnt4" id="ftnt_ref4">[4]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;Europe is an especially important comparator because, since the 1970s, around half of the countries that have abolished capital punishment for all crimes have been European countries.</span><sup class="c2"><a href="#ftnt5" id="ftnt_ref5">[5]</a></sup></p><p class="c9 c6"><span class="c4 c7 c5"></span></p><p class="c9"><span>This report was mainly undertaken as exploratory analysis rather than being designed to test explicit hypotheses regarding strategic effectiveness. Nevertheless, the author hoped that the report would provide evidence for or against the claims regarding effective strategy made in SI&rsquo;s previous two social movement case studies</span><sup class="c2"><a href="#ftnt6" id="ftnt_ref6">[6]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;and would provide strategic insight into the foundational questions in effective animal advocacy.</span><sup class="c2"><a href="#ftnt7" id="ftnt_ref7">[7]</a></sup><span class="c4 c7 c5">&nbsp;As was the case at the start of the author&rsquo;s research into the US anti-abortion movement, the author believed that the US ADPM had mostly failed at achieving its goals and therefore that this report would provide evidence that, on average, the tactics used by the US ADPM should be avoided by the farmed animal movement.</span></p><p class="c9 c6"><span class="c4 c7 c5"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4 c7 c5">In several other ways, this report borrows much of the methodology and framing of SI&rsquo;s previous two social movement case studies.</span></p><p class="c9 c6"><span class="c4 c7 c5"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4 c7 c5">This report uses the terms capital punishment and death penalty interchangeably, although sometimes it is necessary to distinguish between those sentenced to death and those who are actually executed. Likewise, unless otherwise specified, the terms convict, criminal, and prisoner are used interchangeably, since these groups almost completely overlap&nbsp;in the context of this report. This usage is not intended to deny that some criminals are never convicted or that some prisoners have been wrongly convicted. Unless otherwise specified, the term ADPM is used to encompass both advocates of the total abolition of capital punishment and advocates of a national or statewide moratorium (suspension) on executions, even though some advocates of a moratorium may not support a permanent ban. De jure (legally enforced) abolition is sometimes distinguished from de facto abolition, where executions have ceased in practice but have not been legally banned. The term &ldquo;grassroots&rdquo; is used to refer to elements of the movement that include non-professionals, where broad participation is encouraged, and where there is low central control.</span></p><h2 class="c25" id="h.3znysh7"><span class="c4 c11 c5">Summary of Key Implications</span></h2><p class="c9"><span>A single historical case study does not provide strong evidence for any general claim on social change strategy; the value of these case studies comes from providing insight into a large number of important questions.</span><sup class="c2"><a href="#ftnt8" id="ftnt_ref8">[8]</a></sup><span class="c4 c7 c5">&nbsp;This section lists a number of strategic claims supported by the evidence in this report:</span></p><ul class="c15 lst-kix_list_1-0 start"><li class="c9 c10"><span class="c4 c7 c5">Highly salient judicial changes may provide momentum to opposition groups.</span></li><li class="c9 c10"><span class="c4 c7 c5">After controversial Supreme Court rulings, public opinion may move away from the preferences implied by those decisions.</span></li><li class="c9 c10"><span class="c4 c7 c5">Social movements should proactively ensure that professionalization and shifts towards legal strategies do not discourage the growth of grassroots efforts (e.g. broad participation, non-professional, decentralized) that may be more effective longer-term.</span></li><li class="c9 c10"><span class="c4 c7 c5">Legislative change is surprisingly tractable without public support, though public opinion has a significant effect.</span></li><li class="c9 c10"><span class="c4 c7 c5">It is probably easier to introduce and implement unpopular laws if voters in the state do not have ready access to ballot initiatives or referenda.</span></li><li class="c9 c10"><span class="c4 c7 c5">Once influential international bodies adopt a value, they may exert pressure on institutions in other parts of the world to adopt the same value.</span></li><li class="c9 c10"><span class="c4 c7 c5">Abolition of a practice seems likely to encourage public opinion to gradually turn against that practice.</span></li><li class="c9 c10"><span class="c4 c7 c5">Where eliminating a practice is intractable, it may be possible to suspend the practice pending substantial improvements or further research. However, the practice may be subsequently resumed without being substantially challenged.</span></li><li class="c9 c10"><span class="c4 c7 c5">Social movements can collaborate to challenge institutions, though collaboration may be temporary or unreliable.</span></li><li class="c9 c10"><span class="c4 c7 c5">Social change may be more likely to occur if credible professional groups advocate for change before broader participation and pressure is encouraged.</span></li><li class="c9 c10"><span class="c4 c7 c5">As people become more aware of a topic, aggregate attitudes may shift, but polarization may also occur, and legislative change may become less tractable.</span></li><li class="c9 c10"><span class="c4 c7 c5">Messaging that includes supplementary arguments attracts broader support. When using supplementary arguments, advocates should focus on issues that seem unlikely to be fixed without abolition of the targeted institution to minimize the risk that they will backfire in the long term.</span></li><li class="c9 c10"><span class="c4 c5 c7">The changing tone of media coverage can have significant effects on public opinion.</span></li><li class="c9 c10"><span class="c4 c7 c5">Publicizing opinion poll findings that are more favorable to reform of an institution further encourages support for reform.</span></li></ul><h1 class="c39" id="h.2et92p0"><span class="c4 c5 c35">A Condensed Chronological History of the US Anti-Death Penalty Movement</span></h1><p class="c9" id="h.tyjcwt"><span>This condensed history of the US ADPM is not intended to imply causal relationships between listed events, unless such relationships are stated explicitly.

In 724 A.D., Japan&rsquo;s Emperor Shomu, a devout Buddhist, also forbade executions&mdash;as did some early Buddhist rulers in India. In 818 A.D., Japanese Emperor Saga also outlawed the death penalty, effectively abolishing it for the next 300 years, while Emperor Taizong of Tang barred executions in China, leading to an execution-free period there between 747 and 759 A.D. Empress Elizabeth Petrovna (1709-1761) also decreed the suspension of executions in Russia for a short period of time in the 1750s, though the death penalty itself was not formally repealed. In Western Europe, William the Conqueror abolished the death penalty in 1066, though he did so only because he preferred mutilations of the body, such as castration, to executions.&rdquo; On pages 215-20, Bessler illustrates how common these practices were in other contexts.</span></p></div><div><p class="c0"><a href="#ftnt_ref10" id="ftnt10">[10]</a><span class="c1">&nbsp;&ldquo;Bill of Rights [1688],&rdquo; The National Archives, accessed June 27, 2019, </span><span class="c18 c1"><a class="c16" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/aep/WillandMarSess2/1/2/introduction">https://www.legislation.gov.uk/aep/WillandMarSess2/1/2/introduction</a></span><span class="c4 c5 c1">.</span></p></div><div><p class="c0"><a href="#ftnt_ref11" id="ftnt11">[11]</a><span class="c1">&nbsp;John D.

Indeed, the late 18th and early 19th centuries saw the emergence of a privileged class of Enlightenment thinkers and reformers who traveled from court to court, advising rulers who were eager to rule according to the principles of benevolent despotism&hellip; Beccaria, like other reformers, became the object of a sort of bidding war between Empress Catherine of Russia and the Habsburg Empire.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c5 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c22 c1">Robert M.&nbsp;Bohm, </span><span class="c3 c8 c22 c1">Deathquest: An Introduction to the Theory and Practice of Capital Punishment in the United States </span><span class="c8 c22 c1">(New York: Routledge, 2016), 9 lists the poets John Greenleaf Whittier and Walt Whitman, as well as Horace Greeley, the influential founder and editor of </span><span class="c3 c8 c22 c1">The New York Tribune</span><span class="c21 c8 c22 c32 c5 c1">&rdquo; as opponents of the death penalty. Bohm adds that, &ldquo;[w]hereas in 1800, public hangings were mostly solemn events regularly attended by members of all social classes and touted as having important educational value, by mid-century, members of the upper classes were staying away from them because in their minds they had become tasteless, shocking, rowdy, sometimes dangerous, carnival-like spectacles. This view, however, may have been more a matter of perception than reality, as eyewitness accounts suggested that decorum at public executions had not changed that much.

On pages 139-40 Banner adds that, &ldquo;most of the northern debate over eliminating capital punishment was completely absent from the South. No committee of any antebellum southern state legislature recommended complete abolition. The issue was never part of any legislative agenda. Public debates on the subject were not held; societies devoted to abolishing the death penalty were not formed; the pages of magazines and newspapers were not filled with articles taking one side or the other.

Haines summarizes the claims of the opposition as being &ldquo;that the deterrent effect of the death penalty was unique among punishments, and that abolition would subject the nation to an unprecedented onslaught of violent crime. Some also argued that the elimination of </span><span class="c3 c1">legal</span><span class="c4 c5 c1">&nbsp;executions would simply invite an increase in lynching, and that crime-prone immigrant and black populations could only be held in check by the terror of the hangman&rsquo;s noose.&rdquo;</span></p></div><div><p class="c0"><a href="#ftnt_ref50" id="ftnt50">[50]</a><span class="c1">&nbsp;Jeffrey L.

Bessler also mentions &ldquo;the willingness of the Board of Pardons to curtail the use of its pardoning power&rdquo; as a factor, though the timing of this development is unclear. In the absence of any such specific evidence, it seems likely that indirect and long-term factors specific to the Progressive Era but not to Minnesota encouraged the shift.</span></p></div><div><p class="c0"><a href="#ftnt_ref52" id="ftnt52">[52]</a><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c1">Stuart Banner, </span><span class="c3 c8 c1">The Death Penalty: An American History</span><span class="c8 c1">&nbsp;(Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2009), 222.</span></p></div><div><p class="c0"><a href="#ftnt_ref53" id="ftnt53">[53]</a><span class="c1">&nbsp;John F.

By 1968, more than seventy nations had formally rejected capital punishment, including almost all of Western Europe. Countries most like the United States had either abolished the death penalty by that time or at least begun the process. Great Britain temporarily suspended the death penalty in 1965, abandoning it permanently in 1969. Canada imposed a five-year moratorium in 1967, the same year that Australia saw its last execution. New Zealand had abolished the death penalty back in 1961. By the late 1960s, the United States had become an outlier among Western democracies in retaining the death penalty.

Over time, juries maneuvered around the law&rsquo;s harshness by refusing to convict those they wanted to spare, and the law responded by formally recognizing the discretion in capital sentencing that jurors were already exercising in practice. By the turn of the twentieth century, twenty states had moved from mandatory to discretionary death penalty statutes. By 1950, that number had nearly doubled. By the 1960s, mandatory death penalty provisions were virtually nonexistent; a few were still on the books for rare, narrowly defined crimes but they sat largely in desuetude, forgotten relics of a bygone era. Concomitant with this trend, state legislatures also gradually reduced the list of offenses punishable by death. Once available for burglary, sodomy, arson and other serious felonies, capital punishment in the twentieth century became increasingly narrowly prescribed. Between 1930 and 1967, when the moratorium began, ninety-nine percent of all executions were for just two offenses, murder and rape, with murder alone accounting for eighty-seven percent.&rdquo;</span></p></div><div><p class="c0"><a href="#ftnt_ref81" id="ftnt81">[81]</a><span class="c4 c5 c1">&nbsp;See the paragraph beginning &ldquo;In 1957, Hawaii&hellip;&rdquo; below.</span></p></div><div><p class="c0"><a href="#ftnt_ref82" id="ftnt82">[82]</a><span class="c1">&nbsp;Corinna Barrett Lain, &ldquo;</span><span class="c3 c1">Furman</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Fundamentals,&rdquo; </span><span class="c3 c1">Washington Law Review </span><span class="c1">82, no. 1 (2007), 32 notes that, &ldquo;[t]he nation&#39;s most prominent newspapers&mdash;the </span><span class="c3 c1">New York Times</span><span class="c1">, Washington Post, Los Angeles Times, and Philadelphia Inquirer, among others&mdash;all voiced opposition to capital punishment during this time, as did elite organizations like the American Judicature Society, the American Correctional Association, and the National Council on Crime and Delinquency.

In the 1960s, however, the appeals rate skyrocketed. (I am using the word &lsquo;appeals&rsquo; here in a nontechnical sense, to include all the methods by which courts can review criminal convictions and sentences. Strictly speaking, an appeal is just one of them.) Criminal cases represented 14-17 percent of the business of state supreme courts between 1945 and 1960, but 28 percent in 1965 and 1970. Appealed convictions of murder, the crime most likely to carry a death sentence, were 1.7 percent of the caseload in 1935-40 but 6 percent by 1965. Annual petitions for a writ of habeas corpus, the vehicle by which state prisoners can ask federal courts to review their convictions, nearly quadrupled between 1952 and 1963. Part of the increase can be attributed to the increasing crime rate&hellip; But much of the increase in the volume of appeals was the result of Supreme Court decisions in the 1950s and early 1960s that made it procedurally easier to appeal. Another set of Supreme Court decisions gave convicted criminals additional constitutional grounds upon which to base an appeal. By 1965-1970 nearly half the criminal appeals before state supreme courts involved constitutional issues. Only a quarter of criminal appeals had involved claimed violations of the constitution in 1955-60.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c8 c5 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c8 c5 c1">Banner adds on pages 246-7 that &ldquo;[m]any condemned prisoners who appealed got their convictions reversed &mdash; an average of 43 per year between 1961 and 1970, or more than a third of those who had been sentenced to death and more than twice as many as those whose sentences were commuted. Many more on death row were able to stay alive by continuing to litigate. The cumulative population of death rows around the country began to mount, as each freshly condemned prisoner joined those whose appeals were still in progress. The death row population doubled between 1955 and 1961 and doubled again between 1961 and 1969. Each passing year saw a lengthening of the time a person spent on death row before his conviction was reversed, from a median of 17 months in 1962 to 41 months in 1967.&rdquo;</span></p></div><div><p class="c0"><a href="#ftnt_ref91" id="ftnt91">[91]</a><span class="c1">&nbsp;Carol S.

Media portrayals in film and television of offenders escaping punishment because the constable blundered seemed to triumph over the reality that the American prison population was growing exponentially. At the same time, the seemingly vast procedural &lsquo;rights&rsquo; recognized during the Warren Court revolution were undercut both by judicially crafted &lsquo;exceptions&rsquo; to their reach and by the underlying reality that the combination of harsh punishments and overclogged dockets ensured that most criminal defendants would waive their procedural protections to secure plea bargains. The constitutionalization of American criminal procedure, like the constitutionalization of the death penalty, managed to shift attention away from the growing harshness of American criminal punishments to the complicated, costly, and time-consuming procedural mechanisms surrounding their enforcement. The fact that in both contexts the procedures have accomplished little in terms of preventing arbitrary, excessive, or discriminatory punishment ultimately matters less than the fact (or perception) that the federal courts are understood to be keeping a watchful eye over police and prosecutors.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c5 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c5 c1">For more discussion of the possibly negative long-term effects of death penalty regulation, see the strategic implication below beginning &ldquo;There is some evidence that procedural reforms&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p></div><div><p class="c0"><a href="#ftnt_ref92" id="ftnt92">[92]</a><span class="c1">&nbsp;Corinna Barrett Lain, &ldquo;</span><span class="c3 c1">Furman</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Fundamentals,&rdquo; </span><span class="c3 c1">Washington Law Review </span><span class="c4 c5 c1">82, no. 1 (2007), 28.</span></p></div><div><p class="c0"><a href="#ftnt_ref93" id="ftnt93">[93]</a><span class="c1">&nbsp;Herbert H.

The 1960s saw an accelerating trend toward abolitionist sentiment among European and American elites, which often manifested itself as just one aspect of a bold program to completely reform criminal justice and reorient it to the exclusive goal of rehabilitating offenders with the help of the latest psychological insights. Throughout the 1960s, professors from German-speaking countries produced competing proposals for the reform of Germany&rsquo;s Penal Code, which stimulated a broad reform movement culminating in groundbreaking revisions to the Code. In England, Baroness Wootton and other reformers argued tirelessly for the rehabilitation of criminal offenders, and both Conservative and Labour governments drafted wide-ranging White Papers advocating comprehensive reform of criminal justice and corrections. In the United States, the President&rsquo;s Commission on Law Enforcement and the Administration of Justice, commissioned by President Lyndon B. Johnson, issued a 1967 report setting out a comprehensive program for modernizing the criminal justice system and building up programs of reform and rehabilitation. England, for its part, finally passed a law establishing a five-year moratorium on capital punishment in 1965, which was made permanent in 1969. For all this ferment among the educated elite &mdash; Members of Parliament; prominent panelists on government commissions; professors of law, criminology, and sociology; and writers &mdash; the general public in all four countries [the US, UK, France, and Germany] remained staunchly in favor of retaining capital punishment until the mid-1960s, and sometimes beyond.&rdquo;</span></p></div><div><p class="c0"><a href="#ftnt_ref105" id="ftnt105">[105]</a><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c1">Stuart Banner, </span><span class="c3 c8 c1">The Death Penalty: An American History</span><span class="c8 c1">&nbsp;(Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2009), 241.</span></p></div><div><p class="c0"><a href="#ftnt_ref106" id="ftnt106">[106]</a><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c1">Stuart Banner, </span><span class="c3 c8 c1">The Death Penalty: An American History</span><span class="c8 c1">&nbsp;(Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2009), 240-1.</span></p></div><div><p class="c0"><a href="#ftnt_ref107" id="ftnt107">[107]</a><span class="c1">&nbsp;Eric L.

The Legal Defense Fund has now blossomed into a New York office, a Washington, D.C. office, field offices in four southern states, and a full-time legal staff of twenty-three attorneys.

Although the history of the movement against capital punishment in Canada does not parallel that in the United Kingdom, what happened there had an effect on what happened here, and when it was proposed to abolish capital punishment in the United Kingdom, it was thought that a similar move would be made in Canada.

Moreover, West Virginia has no provision for a citizen initiative or statewide referendum&hellip; The experiences in West Virginia and other abolitionist states also reflect the fact that bureaucrats typically support the status quo no matter what that status quo represents.&rdquo;</span></p></div><div><p class="c0"><a href="#ftnt_ref116" id="ftnt116">[116]</a><span class="c1">&nbsp;Carol S.

On pages 111-6, the article describes how abolition legislation was proposed several times but ignored or rejected. In 1981, Francois Mitterand was elected president after announcing his opposition to the death penalty. He subsequently commuted a death sentence. A poll in 1981 showed 62% support for the continued use of the death penalty. Nevertheless, the Chamber (the lower house of the legislature) voted for abolition by 369 votes to 113 in September that year. The Senate approved it by 160 votes to 126. The law entered into force the following day and the six French convicts sentenced to death were reprieved. After three years, an opinion poll found 49% support for this abolition, compared to 46% who regretted the abolition. However, Forst does not cite the polls themselves or the wording used, so it is unclear whether these changed figures represent genuine changes in public opinion. Other recent polls are cited, with support and opposition being split close to 50% each, though Forst claims that &ldquo;abolitionists are still in the minority&rdquo; in France.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c5 c1"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c1">Andrew Hammel, </span><span class="c3 c1">Ending the Death Penalty: The European Experience in Global Perspective </span><span class="c4 c5 c1">(Basingstoke, UK: Palgrave Macmillan, 2010), 180 cites opinion polls between 1978 and 2006 attributed to the same source (&ldquo;TNS/Sofres, 2006&rdquo;), which presumably used consistent wording.

The death row population continued to grow in later years, reaching 620 in 1972, and much of that growth can be attributed to the LDF&rsquo;s efforts, but the greater part of the logjam predated the LDF&rsquo;s involvement in any significant degree of capital litigation.&rdquo; For the details of the earlier origins of this &ldquo;logjam,&rdquo; see footnote 90. Banner argues that, &ldquo;the real achievement of Amsterdam and the LDF lawyers was to get the arguments against the constitutionality of the death penalty before the Supreme Court in a context in which they would be taken seriously&hellip; Even in this respect, however, the LDF was following on the heels of others.&rdquo;</span></p></div><div><p class="c0"><a href="#ftnt_ref158" id="ftnt158">[158]</a><span class="c1">&nbsp;&ldquo;</span><span class="c3 c1">People v.

A further limitation to this evidence is that surveys usually have a margin of error of 1% or more.

Second, the crime rate actually dropped in 1976, while support for the death penalty skyrocketed. Finally, crime had begun to occupy the public consciousness as early as 1966, when pollsters named it the nation&rsquo;s second most important domestic problem and President Johnson issued a special message to Congress on the topic. That same year, however, marked the lowest level of death penalty support in recorded history, with death penalty opponents outnumbering its supporters.&rdquo; Nevertheless, these comparisons are not very informative if crime rates have a lagged effect on death penalty support. On page 73, Lain concludes that, &ldquo;[i]n fairness, perhaps rising crime rates would have led to the return of strong death penalty support anyway.

After crime rates, including homicide rates, fell precipitously in the 1990s, support for the death penalty also fell. The lowest support recorded in the last century for capital punishment was in 1966 and the highest was in 1994. The crime rates story is not a perfect fit (because crime rates were rising before 1966 and falling before 1994), but after allowing for some lag-time, the relevance of crime rates to support for capital punishment seems plausible.&rdquo;</span></p></div><div><p class="c0"><a href="#ftnt_ref183" id="ftnt183">[183]</a><span class="c1">&nbsp;Katherine Beckett and Theodore Sasson, </span><span class="c3 c1">The Politics of Injustice: Crime and Punishment in America</span><span class="c4 c5 c1">&nbsp;(Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications, 2004), 105-6 shows that survey results for the &ldquo;percent of Americans afraid to walk alone at night within a mile of their homes&rdquo; peaked at just under 50%, compared to low points of around 30% in 1967 and 2001.

First, levels of fear have been fairly stable compared to the homicide rate. Second, fear of crime does not necessarily lead to punitiveness, and those who are not personally fearful are often among the most punitive. Finally, killers make up only a tiny percentage of officially sanctioned criminals. It appears, then, that high rates of homicide play a small and indirect role in the generation of popular support for get-tough crime policies.&rdquo;</span></p></div><div><p class="c0"><a href="#ftnt_ref184" id="ftnt184">[184]</a><span class="c1">&nbsp;Timothy R.

In 1994, the same year 52% of Americans identified crime as the nation&rsquo;s most important problem, a record 85% also reported that the courts were not harsh enough.

In his attempt to defeat Democratic candidate Lyndon B. Johnson, Goldwater capitalized on white Americans&rsquo; fears that rising crime rates and civil rights activists&rsquo; illegal direct action tactics were leading to a chaotic society governed by &lsquo;the license of the mob and the jungle.&rsquo; Four years later, after an unprecedented spike in urban rioting, massive student-led anti-war protests, and still growing crime rates, Republican Richard Milhous Nixon rode a wave of heightened fear to narrowly defeat Democratic candidate Herbert Humphrey with a campaign centered on a promise to deliver &lsquo;law-and-order&rsquo; to a nation fraught with social strife. In artfully produced television ads, Nixon&rsquo;s steady voice, cast over haunting music and graphic images of urban riots and militant youth protests, promised to defend &lsquo;decent citizens&rsquo; from the threat of &lsquo;domestic violence&rsquo; posed by street criminals and leftist radicals. Nixon&rsquo;s speeches and television ads conflated radical protest with street crime, and fueled a cultural discourse that interpreted both as products of Kennedy and Johnson era liberalism and an inadequate US criminal justice system. Like Goldwater, Nixon deliberately employed racially coded law-and-order rhetoric in order to appeal to urban whites fearful of increased crime rates and the perceived excesses of the black liberation struggle. As special counsel to the President, John Ehrlichman, explained of his boss&rsquo;s strategy, &lsquo;that subliminal appeal to the anti-black voter was always present in Nixon&rsquo;s statements and speeches.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c5 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">See also the paragraph beginning &ldquo;From the 1950s, conservative governors&hellip;&rdquo; above.

Despite growing prosperity, crime rose steadily throughout the late 1950s, and became a pressing issue for the Conservative governments of Anthony Eden (who retired in 1957 in the wake of the Suez Crisis) and Harold MacMillan, who governed until 1964. Responding to concern about crime, both Conservative and Labour governments, in the late 1950s and early 1960s, prepared White Papers proposing a sweeping modernization of English criminal justice. Reflecting the approach to crime control which David Garland (1984) has called &lsquo;penal welfarism,&rsquo; English technocrats and civil servants analyzed penal law as one of a series of state interventions in social life designed to address the needs of socially vulnerable populations and support the reintegration of marginalized groups. This approach necessarily entails a view of crime less as a partisan battlefield and more as a social problem in need of humane and well-researched counter-strategies. Thus, it was a Conservative government that published, in 1959, a landmark White Paper called </span><span class="c3 c1">Penal Practice in a Changing Society</span><span class="c4 c5 c1">, which proposed sweeping changes to the British criminal justice system, including the establishment of a center of criminology to study the root causes of crime, expanding and modernizing the prison system with an emphasis on rehabilitation, developing alternative sentencing practices to keep young offenders out of prison, streamlining the criminal adjudication process, modernizing psychiatric and psychological care in prisons, and building up prison after-care programs to ease former prisoners&rsquo; transition into society. Regardless of the tone of the debate in broader society, the bureaucratic elite of post-war Britain valued a &lsquo;modern&rsquo; approach to crime and punishment. MacMillan&rsquo;s Conservative government continued to issue White Papers along similar lines until its ouster in the 1964 general elections. Broadly similar policies were pursued by MacMillan&rsquo;s Labour successors.&rdquo; </span></p></div><div><p class="c0"><a href="#ftnt_ref212" id="ftnt212">[212]</a><span class="c1">&nbsp;Andrew Hammel, </span><span class="c3 c1">Ending the Death Penalty: The European Experience in Global Perspective </span><span class="c4 c5 c1">(Basingstoke, UK: Palgrave Macmillan, 2010), 108 notes that, &ldquo;[o]ne recent estimate suggests that in the decade after 1957, the proportion of abolitionists within Conservative ranks doubled from one-eighth of all MPs to one-quarter.&rdquo; On page 168, Hammel adds that, &ldquo;Conservative Party leader Ted Heath&rsquo;s openly abolitionist views lent decisive impulses to the abolition movement in the late 1960s by giving hesitant Tories cover to vote against the views of their constituents.&rdquo; Nevertheless, at various points in the chapter, Hammel describes the Labour Party as more strongly anti-death penalty than the Conservative Party.

Attempts during 1973 and 1974 to secure additional funding for a five-year, $150,000 capital punishment research project were unsuccessful. Nevertheless, 25 research ideas were developed.

On pages 11-12, Lowe explains that this was based on &ldquo;a population of articles, which either a) were written by an ADP movement participant or b) featured the perspective of an ADP movement participant. I considered all speakers who affirmatively advanced an ADP position as movement participants, given that their willingness to have their views published in the newspaper provided a minimum threshold of engagement with the issue. Furthermore, I did not include articles featuring vague references to the views of death penalty opponents; rather, I selected only those articles that contained either a direct quote or a clear reference to a specific statement made by a movement participant&hellip; Following this rationale, I also excluded the speech of politicians and judges.&rdquo; Lowe &ldquo;opted to review a five-percent sample of the results, sorted by &lsquo;Relevance&rsquo; to ensure I would capture the most relevant discourse in my review&hellip; From this population, I then selected a systematic random sample stratified by era, which aimed to yield a representative set of documents and allow me to generalize about the ADP movement as a whole. Specifically, I first sorted the population within a given era by publication date. Within that population, I then sampled articles at an interval that would yield at least thirty articles, distributed proportionally by publication date. Repeated across each of the five eras, this process yielded a final sample size of 154 documents.&rdquo; On page 13, Lowe explains that they coded by &ldquo;three main types of movement participants: activists, who affiliate with movement groups or otherwise deliberately engage in policy debates and legislative efforts toward reform or abolition; advocates, who litigate on behalf of the capital clients they represent; and sympathizers, who lack official affiliation with movement groups but affirmatively oppose the death penalty.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c5 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c5 c1">On 14, Lowe notes that they &ldquo;sorted these frames into categories, and then further classified the categories into two larger clusters, instrumental or moral. Instrumental frames refer to the group of frames that contain objections to the death penalty based on its effects, including problems with its procedures, applications, and material costs. Frames included in the moral cluster, by contrast, invoke both secular and religious concerns about the fundamental nature of capital punishment and its violation of humanity, dignity, or civilized values. While many of the frames implicate both moral and instrumental reasoning, I conceive the key difference to be the inherence of the moral objection, compared to the solvability of the instrumental objection&hellip; For each article, I coded both the primary frame the movement participant used, as well as other frames present within their discourse.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c5 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c5 c1">The categorization by era revolves around Supreme Court decisions.

One of the strongest predictors of a state&rsquo;s propensity to conduct executions today is its history of lynch mob activity more than a century ago. Given this connection, it is no surprise that the current map of active death penalty states is predominantly a map of the former Confederacy; not a single state from that region is among the twenty-nine states that either have abolished capital punishment or have conducted no more than three executions since 1976.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c42 c34 c32 c5"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c34 c1">On page 20 they summarize that, &ldquo;[t]he racial resonances of the death penalty extended well beyond the era of Reconstruction.

Sociologist David Garland offered a broader, complementary account of the contemporary meanings of capital punishment in the South: &lsquo;Support for the death penalty [in the South in the late twentieth century] became a marker of respect for states&rsquo; rights and traditional authority; a respectable (that is to say, not openly racist) means of asserting that the civil rights movement had gone too far; and a vehicle for Southern resentment about interference by Northern liberals.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c42 c34 c32 c5"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c34 c1">On page 119 they note that, between 1977 and 2015, &ldquo;[o]ver a quarter of executions conducted outside of the South and its borders (55 out of 201) involved &lsquo;volunteers&rsquo;&mdash;defendants who had given up their appeals.

In Massachusetts, no executions had taken place since 1947. This was partly due to refusals by governors to carry out court-ordered death sentences and partly due to the alternative sentencing law that was passed in 1951 following advocacy from the Massachusetts Council Against the Death Penalty (MCADP). </span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c5 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c5 c1">The MCADP had focused on lobbying legislators, appearing annually before the Joint House-Senate Judiciary Committee, despite the advice of the ALACP to focus on campaigning for a referendum. Rogers adds that, &ldquo;[t]hese annual appeals urged lawmakers to enact a bill abolishing the death penalty, a law permitting jurors to recommend mercy, and a resolution establishing a commission to study capital punishment. The second prong of the MCADP&#39;s strategy focused on specific capital cases to illustrate to legislators and to fix public attention on the glaring imperfections of murder investigations and capital procedure. Of course, Ehrmann also wanted to bring as many people as possible into the abolition campaign, but she was interested chiefly in recruiting political, religious, and civic leaders, men and women whose names flanked the MCADP&rsquo;s letterhead. Third, Ehrmann brought pressure to bear on sitting governors not to sign execution orders.&rdquo; At other points on pages 285-313, Rogers notes that the MCADP&rsquo;s tactics included maintaining connections with individual politicians, including the state&rsquo;s governors, letter-writing campaigns to legislators, and inviting Boston&rsquo;s mayor to become vice-chairman of the MCADP.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c5 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In 1957, the legislature appointed a commission to study capital punishment in the state.

Following the election in 1962 of a Democratic governor who publicly opposed the death penalty, another abolition bill was debated; the MCADP had competed with the Massachusetts Police Chiefs&rsquo; Association in their lobbying efforts. In 1968, a referendum was held on the issue, encouraged by the governor at the time; 49% voted in favor of retaining the death penalty, 31% voted against it, and 20% left their ballot blank.

Bush&rsquo;s presidential campaign, were responsible for the majority of articles. In fact, the eight journalists with the greatest number of stories published together combined for fifty-seven, or about 20 percent, of the articles that year. Besides 57 articles written by the eight journalists with the most common bylines, there were 21 Associated Press stories, 14 editorials, 6 Reuters stories, and 137 stories written by 125 different authors/sources (this includes op-eds). In sum, the articles that appeared in the paper were written by a variety of sources, not a single journalist or small group of them on a campaign to publicize this issue. It was a large and collective event.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c5 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c5 c1">Despite this argument, 20% of articles on a particular topic in a specific year seems like a substantial proportion, which may well have sparked increased interest among other papers. This doesn&rsquo;t seem likely to have contributed substantially to the fall in public support for the death penalty, however, given that public support was actually higher in 2002.</span></p></div><div><p class="c0"><a href="#ftnt_ref312" id="ftnt312">[312]</a><span class="c1">&nbsp;Frank R.

Boydstun, </span><span class="c3 c1">The Decline of the Death Penalty and the Discovery of Innocence</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;(Cambridge University Press: New York, 2008), 132. Their argument seems plausible, given the increase in overall coverage, hostility to the death penalty within that coverage, and explicit discussion of innocence. However, these changes could potentially have been driven by some other factor. On pages 132-3, they describe a detailed analysis of </span><span class="c3 c1">New York Times </span><span class="c4 c5 c1">articles and conclude that &ldquo;the surge in attention to the death penalty in 2000&rdquo; was not &ldquo;the work of a few dogged journalists&rdquo; focusing on the presidential election campaign, since there is not &ldquo;prominent mention either of the campaign in general, of individual politicians, or of particular death penalty cases over which George W. Bush had presided,&rdquo; with the coverage instead centering &ldquo;around the concept of innocence: DNA testing, the possibility of executing the wrongly accused, and the death penalty moratorium declared by pro-death penalty Illinois governor George Ryan.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c5 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c5 c1">They note that their &ldquo;review of all the articles published in 2000 shows that Texas did, in fact, receive substantial death penalty media coverage in 2000, with close to 50 percent of articles mentioning Texas. However, many articles in fact made reference to more than one state, with references to Texas constituting only about 30 percent of the total references to all states. (This amount is approximately the same percentage as Texas contributes to the national rate of death sentences.) Although Governor George W. Bush was mentioned in approximately 36 percent of the articles in 200, only 12 percent of the articles made reference to the electoral contest. In contrast, then-Illinois governor George Ryan was mentioned in approximately 16 percent of the articles, and the state of Illinois was referenced in about 20 percent of them. These findings suggest that coverage of the death penalty in Texas was framed around particular fairness, humanistic, and legal issues that emerged in particular cases rather than Bush and his bid for the presidency. Indeed, about 50 percent of all death penalty articles in 2000 made reference to one or more specific death penalty cases.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c5 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This analysis seems to fairly convincingly rule out the political events of the year 2000 as the main spark for the increase in coverage plus the increases in hostility to the death penalty and discussion of innocence in that coverage in the year 2000 specifically. However, each of these trends began before that year. Declines in violent crime, the publication of Helen Prejean&rsquo;s </span><span class="c3 c1">Dead Man Walking</span><span class="c4 c5 c1">, increased opposition to the death penalty among Supreme Court justices, and the efforts of a small group of journalists in Austin may all have encouraged these trends.</span></p></div><div><p class="c0"><a href="#ftnt_ref313" id="ftnt313">[313]</a><span class="c1">&nbsp;Frank R.

However, their analysis found no significant &ldquo;[s]hort-run (change in) opinion&rdquo; for the combined measure of these events. On page 189 they note that, &ldquo;[w]hen each event was entered into the model separately&hellip; only Governor Ryan&rsquo;s grant of clemency to all death row prisoners in the first quarter of 2003, just before leaving office, is significant (p = 0.09)...

In each database, I ran keyword searches for nonprofits using the terms &lsquo;death penalty,&rsquo; &lsquo;capital punishment,&rsquo; and &lsquo;execution.&rsquo; In addition, I ran a parallel search in the NCCS database for all groups with an NTEE activity code of R60, which is assigned to tax-exempt entities that work on civil liberties, including death penalty issues. After discarding all duplicates, I filtered the results of these searches in two ways: first, I excluded all organizations that did not have to file an IRS 990 form for any year in the given eleven-year window. This step excludes many of the smaller organizations in the population, but since this study focuses on the impact that outcomes have on public financial support, the lack of 990 forms imposes an absolute and unavoidable threshold for inclusion. Second, I handchecked all remaining groups to verify that they did, in fact, have ADP activism as a core activity, using information contained in their 990 forms as well as on their websites. If there was any ambiguity about a group&rsquo;s programmatic focus, I chose to exclude it&hellip;.

The Court thus articulated expressly for the first time what this Article calls the &lsquo;unreliability principle:&rsquo; if too great a risk exists that constitutionally protected mitigation cannot be reliably assessed, the unreliability means that the death penalty cannot be constitutionally imposed. In recognizing the unreliability principle, the Court has called into serious question the death penalty for other offenders to whom the principle applies, such as mentally ill defendants. And, unlike with the &lsquo;evolving standards&rsquo; analysis, the unreliability principle does not depend on whether a national consensus exists against the practice.&rdquo; This principle &ldquo;has profound implications for the death penalty, and if taken to its logical endpoint calls into question the Court&rsquo;s core premise since </span><span class="c3 c1">Furman v.

Virginia</span><span class="c1">, in June 2002, the Supreme Court held that the execution of any individual with mental retardation violated the Eighth Amendment&rsquo;s prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment, referring not only to the number of U.S. states that had abolished the death penalty for the mentally retarded, but also to international opinion on the matter. The Court&rsquo;s opinion made specific reference to the </span><span class="c3 c1">amicus curiae </span><span class="c1">brief filed by the European Union supporting such a ban. In March 2005, when the Supreme Court ruled that imposing the death penalty on convicted murderers who were younger than eighteen at the time of their crimes was unconstitutional, international opinion seemed to contribute even more forcefully to that decision. In the Court&rsquo;s majority opinion in </span><span class="c3 c1">Roper v. Simmons</span><span class="c4 c5 c1">, Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote, &lsquo;It is proper that we acknowledge the overwhelming weight of international opinion against the juvenile death penalty, resting in large part on the understanding that the instability and emotional imbalance of young people may often be a factor in the crime,&rsquo; adding that there was an emerging national consensus against juvenile execution. The Court further noted that the execution of juvenile offenders violated several international treaties, including the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The Court also pointed out that the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, which prohibits the juvenile death penalty, has been ratified by every country except Somalia and the United States. In a dissent, Justice Anthonin Scalia rejected the Court&rsquo;s use of international law to confirm its finding of a national consensus, stating that &lsquo;&lsquo;acknowledgement&rsquo; of foreign approval has no place in the legal opinion of this Court.&rsquo; He wrote: &lsquo;The court thus proclaims itself sole arbiter of our nation&rsquo;s moral standards.&rsquo; This opinion was shared by many others around the nation.&rdquo;</span></p></div><div><p class="c0"><a href="#ftnt_ref387" id="ftnt387">[387]</a><span class="c1">&nbsp;&ldquo;European Convention on Human Rights,&rdquo; European Court of Human Rights, accessed June 26, 2019, </span><span class="c18 c1"><a class="c16" href="https://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/Convention_ENG.pdf">https://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/Convention_ENG.pdf</a></span><span class="c4 c5 c1">.</span></p></div><div><p class="c0"><a href="#ftnt_ref388" id="ftnt388">[388]</a><span class="c1">&nbsp;&ldquo;Maryland,&rdquo; Death Penalty Information Center, accessed November 1, 2019, </span><span class="c18 c1"><a class="c16" href="https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/state-and-federal-info/state-by-state/maryland">https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/state-and-federal-info/state-by-state/maryland</a></span><span class="c4 c5 c1">.</span></p></div><div><p class="c0"><a href="#ftnt_ref389" id="ftnt389">[389]</a><span class="c4 c5 c1">&nbsp;See footnote 236.</span></p></div><div><p class="c0"><a href="#ftnt_ref390" id="ftnt390">[390]</a><span class="c1">&nbsp;Frank R.

Rather than focusing their lobbying efforts on moral and religious arguments, Fitzgerald and NJADP emphasized the costs of the death penalty, wrongful executions, and the fact that New Jersey had not executed anyone in forty years. Specifically, NJADP commissioned a fiscal study of the state&rsquo;s death penalty system, which found that abolishing the death penalty would save New Jersey more than $11 million each year. According to Fitzgerald, by focusing on the costs of capital cases, NJADP was able to &lsquo;attract [support from] people who thought the death penalty was simply another waste of time and money&rsquo;... Partly as a result of the lobbying efforts of the NJADP, in 2006 the New Jersey legislature selected a state-sponsored Death Penalty Study Commission to examine the effectiveness of the state&rsquo;s death penalty policy. The Commission held hearings and heard from New Jersey residents on both sides of the debate. Testimonies provided evidence about the significant costs of the death penalty, as well as polls showing that only 36% of New Jersey residents preferred the death penalty to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. In addition to relying on savings estimates from various New Jersey state agencies, the Commission considered cost studies conducted by other states. In its 2007 report, the Commission recommended that the New Jersey legislature abolish the death penalty in the state. It found that capital punishment in New Jersey did not &lsquo;rationally serve a legitimate penological intent,&rsquo; and that &lsquo;[t]he costs of the death penalty are greater than the costs of life in prison without parole.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c5 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c1">Robert J.

For example, on page 696, McLaughlin notes that, &ldquo;[w]hen the effort to abolish New Mexico&rsquo;s death penalty began in 1997, advocates attempted to introduce the cost argument into the death penalty debate. At the time, however, there was very little information available about the costs of New Mexico&rsquo;s death penalty system. Thus, anti-death penalty advocates did not focus on costs as a central part of their campaign until several years later&hellip; [T]he State Bar&rsquo;s Task Force on the Administration of the Death Penalty in New Mexico published a report in 2004 outlining the reasons for the high costs of capital cases. Around the same time, then New Mexico Supreme Court Justice Bosson estimated that the cost of a capital case in New Mexico was six times higher than noncapital murder cases. The cost argument in New Mexico was also strengthened by cost studies from other states, such as North Carolina, which found that capital punishment cost more than life imprisonment.&rdquo;</span></p></div><div><p class="c0"><a href="#ftnt_ref420" id="ftnt420">[420]</a><span class="c1">&nbsp;Jolie McLaughlin, &ldquo;The price of justice: Interest-convergence, cost, and the anti-death penalty movement,&rdquo; </span><span class="c3 c1">Northwestern University Law Review</span><span class="c4 c5 c1">&nbsp;108, no. 2 (2013), 697 notes that, &ldquo;[a]lthough few legislators mentioned cost when they publicly spoke in support of repeal, state legislators were well aware of the cost implications of the bill by the time they cast their votes in 2009. For instance, David Keys, a professor of criminology at New Mexico State University, testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee and told the panel that a single execution in New Mexico cost the state between $2.75 and $5 million. Viki Harrison, the former Executive Director of NM Repeal, believes that state policymakers considered cost as a factor in casting their votes, even if they did not say so explicitly.&rdquo; For descriptions of the role of the cost argument in encouraging abolition in the other states, see pages 698-704.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c5 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c5 c1">Delaware and Washington are excluded from this list solely because at the time that McLaughlin was writing, they had not yet abolished capital punishment and the author has not seen other evidence on the importance of this factor in those locations.</span></p></div><div><p class="c0"><a href="#ftnt_ref421" id="ftnt421">[421]</a><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c1">&ldquo;Tennessee,&rdquo; Death Penalty Information Center, accessed November 1, 2019, </span><span class="c18 c8 c1"><a class="c16" href="https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/state-and-federal-info/state-by-state/tennessee">https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/state-and-federal-info/state-by-state/tennessee</a></span><span class="c4 c5 c1">.</span></p></div><div><p class="c0"><a href="#ftnt_ref422" id="ftnt422">[422]</a><span class="c1">&nbsp;&ldquo;Steiker Study Inspires Withdrawal of Death Penalty Section from Model Penal Code,&rdquo; Harvard Law Today (January 7, 2010), </span><span class="c18 c1"><a class="c16" href="https://today.law.harvard.edu/steiker-study-inspires-withdrawal-of-death-penalty-section-from-model-penal-code/">https://today.law.harvard.edu/steiker-study-inspires-withdrawal-of-death-penalty-section-from-model-penal-code/</a></span><span class="c4 c5 c1">.</span></p></div><div><p class="c0"><a href="#ftnt_ref423" id="ftnt423">[423]</a><span class="c1">&nbsp;Carol S.

Texas, Oklahoma, and Virginia carried out executions within weeks of the Court&rsquo;s decision, while many other states are still mired in lethal injection litigation. Again, the difference in reactions has less to do with the content of federal regulation (which is actually quite minimal) than with the legal and cultural norms within the different jurisdictions as well as the surrounding politics. In some states, demanding administrative laws make it cumbersome to alter execution protocols, whereas in other states, the autonomy of prison officials to &lsquo;adapt&rsquo; to drug shortages or potential protocol problems is the norm. States also differ in the extent to which legislative and executive officials have sought to study protocol alternatives, with some states seeking quick resolution to facilitate executions and others moving much more slowly. The experience with lethal injection litigation provides a window into the ways regulation is filtered through layers of culture, law, and politics; those layers give actors with qualms about the death penalty the means of avoiding executions, and allow those deeply committed to the death penalty to express their support.&rdquo;</span></p></div><div><p class="c0"><a href="#ftnt_ref430" id="ftnt430">[430]</a><span class="c1">&nbsp;&ldquo;Arkansas,&rdquo; Death Penalty Information Center, accessed November 1, 2019, </span><span class="c18 c1"><a class="c16" href="https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/state-and-federal-info/state-by-state/arkansas">https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/state-and-federal-info/state-by-state/arkansas</a></span><span class="c4 c5 c1">.</span></p></div><div><p class="c0"><a href="#ftnt_ref431" id="ftnt431">[431]</a><span class="c1">&nbsp;Mary D.

Not only have many counties de facto abolished the death penalty, but many others have employed it only sparingly&mdash;once or twice a decade. Fairfax County, Virginia, for example, with a population of nearly one million, imposed only five death sentences between 1973 and 1995. Conversely, a relatively small number of counties account for an extraordinary proportion of the nation&rsquo;s death verdicts. During the same period, Seminole County, Georgia, had the same number of death sentences as Virginia&rsquo;s Fairfax County but had a population more than 100 times smaller. Similarly, Hillsborough County (Tampa), Florida, with about the same population as Fairfax, imposed over thirteen times more death sentences (sixty-seven). More than half of the death sentences imposed nationwide over the twenty-three-year Broken System study period originated in only sixty-six, or 2%, of the nation&rsquo;s 3143 counties, parishes, and boroughs. Sixteen percent of the nation&rsquo;s counties (510 out of 3143) accounted for 90% of its death verdicts in the period.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c5 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Relatedly, Lee Kovarsky, &ldquo;Muscle Memory and the Local Concentration of Capital Punishment,&rdquo; </span><span class="c3 c1">Duke Law Journal </span><span class="c4 c5 c1">66, no. 2 (November 2016), 259-330 also concludes that, &ldquo;(1) capital sentencing is concentrating dramatically; (2) executions are concentrating more gradually; and (3) both trends persist within most capitally active states.&rdquo;</span></p></div><div><p class="c0"><a href="#ftnt_ref497" id="ftnt497">[497]</a><span class="c1">&nbsp;Andrew Hammel, </span><span class="c3 c1">Ending the Death Penalty: The European Experience in Global Perspective </span><span class="c4 c5 c1">(Basingstoke, UK: Palgrave Macmillan, 2010), 13 notes that, &ldquo;[w]hen one examines the paths taken by the 54 nations that first abolished the death penalty either for ordinary crime in peacetime or for all crimes since the end of 1988, one finds that by the end of June 2009, 51 of them (94 per cent) had abolished it for all crimes completely and another three countries solely for murder and other ordinary crimes.

Interestingly, neither crime nor homicide rates themselves predict high reversal rates and the high death-sentencing rates that go with them. What is predictive, however, is a high rate of homicide victimization of white residents relative to the rate of homicides affecting black residents. While in virtually all communities, the homicide rate experienced by African-American citizens is greater than that experienced by whites, in heavy death-sentencing communities that disparity is smaller. Other things equal, the smaller the disparity is between white and black homicide victimization, the higher the death-sentencing rate is. Heavy use of the death penalty thus seems to occur when the worst effects of crime have spilled over from poor and minority neighborhoods and are particularly salient to parts of the community that we can predict will have greater influence over local law enforcement, prosecution, and judicial officials.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c5 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c5 c1">Relatedly, on page 270-1, they note that usage of the death penalty was correlated with &ldquo;proximity to a large population of either African-American citizens or citizens receiving government welfare support.&rdquo; There was an interaction effect between these factors: &ldquo;In communities where both conditions are present&mdash;a large African-American community nearby and a high rate of white homicide victimization relative to black homicide victimization&mdash;the death-sentencing rate is higher than one would expect by simply summing the effect of each of those factors by itself.&rdquo; </span></p></div><div><p class="c0"><a href="#ftnt_ref504" id="ftnt504">[504]</a><span class="c1">&nbsp;James S.

For example, &lsquo;legally, the death penalty for consensual same-sex sexual conduct between adults is possible in Afghanistan, Brunei Darussalam, Iran, Mauritania, some norther states of Nigeria, Pakistan, Saudia Arabia, the southern region of Somalia, Sudan and Yemen, due in part to the application of Islamic Shari&rsquo;&#257; law. Furthermore, the influence of Shari&rsquo;&#257; law is spreading. In October 2013, the Sultanate of Brunei introduced a new Shari&rsquo;&#257;-based Penal Code, parts of which came into force on 1 May 2014.

When formerly authoritarian regimes liberalize into pluralist democracies, their governments transition from high levels of executions to no executions (South Korea) or very few (Taiwan). There are only two exceptions to a perfect fit between authoritarian government and state execution.

Haines describes several other debates on pages 118-47, such as the proper roles of litigation and public-facing advocacy, the extent to which the personalities of convicts should be emphasized (as opposed to focusing on the generic morality of executing humans), whether direct action should be used, whether life imprisonment without parole should be offered as an alternative to capital punishment or not, and the extent to which the anti-death penalty movement should seek collaboration with other movements.</span></p></div><div><p class="c0"><a href="#ftnt_ref524" id="ftnt524">[524]</a><span class="c1">&nbsp;Sandra J.

For example, &ldquo;Mark... a white man in his mid-thirties who heads up one of the anti-death penalty organizations&rdquo; in Delaware said that some people &ldquo;seem like they are junkies for execution night vigils&hellip; Some of us refer to them as &lsquo;candle clutchers.&rsquo; They are certainly not abolitionists. We call them passive abolitionists, also known as pro-death penalty&hellip; If you&rsquo;re passive about the death penalty, but you don&rsquo;t do anything to shut it down or are unwilling to do anything controversial, our attitude it basically that it does just as much to keep the death penalty going as people who are avidly pro-death penalty.&rdquo; At least two other interviewees shared some of these sentiments. Included quotes from interviewees who preferred vigils to disobedience were somewhat critical of the latter strategy: &ldquo;They like to brag about getting arrested, but that&rsquo;s not the goal. If their goal is getting arrested, then they&rsquo;re doing a good job. If it&rsquo;s public education, I&rsquo;m not so sure that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re doing. When I was involved, we went for more one-day conferences and we did things in a quiet way.&rdquo; An interviewee from the Coalition Against State Executions spoke of the Campaign to End the Death Penalty: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll organize the vigils and one of the reasons we do that is that we don&rsquo;t want the Campaign organizing the vigils because we feel like if they organize it, then it will be aggressive, hostile, and confrontational and we don&rsquo;t want them to be like that..

On the other hand, the nine case studies discussed support our assertion that executions and population diversity are strongly associated. The tendency to execute racial and ethnic minorities characterizes the execution histories of the abolitionist states. When Maine, Alaska, Hawaii, North Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin, West Virginia, and Michigan performed executions, racial and ethnic minorities were the victims of choice.

When soldiers are dying on the battlefield, society members care less about the lives of criminals. Even though the carnage of war has often weakened the public&rsquo;s outrage against capital punishment, some of the greatest death penalty abolition periods have coincided roughly with American involvement in unpopular wars. One possible explanation is that unpopular wars motivate some in the public to take action on social issues. So, abolition movements showed some success during the early years of the Vietnam War, during the Iraq War, and during a period around World War I. The wars, of course, do not dictate abolition movements, but wars and other large events affect society and people&rsquo;s views on social issues. Similarly, economic hard times and other societal events may result in less concern for convicted criminals.&rdquo; It seems fair to characterize the periods of the Vietnam War (1955-75) and Iraq War (2003-11) as having higher interest in abolition than other periods of recent US history, though there is little evidence that this interest was substantially influenced by the wars themselves. Any changes during the period of World War I (1914-8) seem more attributable to ongoing trends related to the Progressive Era than to the war itself.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c5 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c5 c1">See also the paragraph beginning &ldquo;The Mexican War (1846-8)&hellip;&rdquo; in &ldquo;A Condensed Chronological History of the US Anti-Death Penalty Movement.&rdquo; </span></p></div><div><p class="c0"><a href="#ftnt_ref543" id="ftnt543">[543]</a><span class="c1">&nbsp;See, for example, Mona Lynch, &ldquo;Capital Punishment as Moral Imperative: Pro-Death-Penalty Discourse on the Internet,&rdquo; </span><span class="c3 c1">Punishment &amp; Society </span><span class="c1">4, no. 2 (2002), 213-36 and Christopher Mooney and Mei-Hsien Lee, &ldquo;The Influence of Values on Consensus and Contentious Morality Policy: U.S. Death Penalty Reform, 1956&ndash;1982,&rdquo; </span><span class="c3 c1">Journal of Politics</span><span class="c4 c5 c1">&nbsp;62, no. 1 (2000), 223&ndash;39.</span></p></div><div><p class="c0"><a href="#ftnt_ref544" id="ftnt544">[544]</a><span class="c4 c5 c1">&nbsp;See, for example, the paragraphs beginning &ldquo;From 1988 onwards&hellip;&rdquo;, &ldquo;In 2007, New Jersey abolished&hellip;&rdquo;, and &ldquo;In 2011, several conservatives&hellip;&rdquo; in &ldquo;A Condensed Chronological History of the US Anti-Death Penalty Movement.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c5 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c1">Frank E.

But public acceptance cannot be measured by the existence of death penalty statutes or by the fact that some juries impose death on criminal defendants&hellip; Although death penalty statutes do remain on the books of many jurisdictions, and public opinion polls show opinion to be divided as to capital punishment as an abstract proposition, the infrequency of its actual application suggests that among those persons called upon to actually impose or carry out the death penalty it is being repudiated with ever increasing frequency&hellip; The steady decrease in the number of executions from a high of 199 in 1935 to 2 in 1967, in spite of a growing population and notwithstanding the statutory sanction of the death penalty, persuasively demonstrates that capital punishment is unacceptable to society today. The cruelty of capital punishment lies not only in the execution itself and the pain incident thereto, but also in the dehumanizing effects of the lengthy imprisonment prior to execution during which the judicial and administrative procedures essential to due process of law are carried out.

They add that, &ldquo;[s]ome of the pressures are fiscal: the skyrocketing costs associated with the death penalty have become perhaps the central threat to its continued viability. Apart from costs, though, regulation has turned the extended delays that were part of the moratorium strategy in the 1960s into a permanent and irreversible feature of the capital justice system. Executions are no longer the ordinary or even expected result of death sentences in many jurisdictions, and despite being relatively undemanding, constitutional regulation has contributed mightily to that result. The failure of states to consummate death sentences with executions is an existential threat to retention. Two of the other primary causes of the present fragility&mdash;widespread concern about wrongful convictions and the introduction of life without parole as the default alternative punishment to death&mdash;are by-products of the newly regulated environment.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c5 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As an example of this process, they note on pages 196-8 that, &ldquo;[t]he range of organizations supporting capital trial efforts exploded in the decades following the 1976 cases.&rdquo; They provide examples of several nonprofits, such as the Equal Justice Initiative and add that, prior to </span><span class="c3 c1">Furman</span><span class="c1">, &ldquo;[s]tates did not have capital defender offices or capital resource centers, law schools did not house capital punishment clinics, and there were no nonprofit organizations devoted primarily to improving capital lawyering or providing direct representation in capital cases.&rdquo; They do not explain why they believe that such changes stemmed from post-</span><span class="c3 c1">Furman </span><span class="c4 c5 c1">regulation, though this seems like a plausible explanation.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c5 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c5 c1">They likewise argue on page 198 that, &ldquo;[t]he emergence of institutional structures supporting the defense mission in capital trials is directly responsible for numerous changes to capital trial practice.

In the USA public opinion has apparently driven a multitude of domestic policies such as term limits, tax cuts and a patients Bill of Rights. In the USA justice system public opinion instigated laws such as Megan&rsquo;s law, &lsquo;three strikes&rsquo; laws, the Brady Bill and the assault weapon ban. In the UK the Labour government has placed an emphasis on &lsquo;evidence-based&rsquo; policy formation and uses focus groups, the People&rsquo;s Panel, citizens&rsquo; juries and opinion surveys to gauge public opinion before forming new policies. As a result, in both the UK and USA significant policy changes have been attributed to the influence of public opinion.

For example, Hammel notes on pages 66-70 that &ldquo;Dr. Thomas Dehler of the Free Democratic Party, an attorney was who [in 1949] the Justice Minister in the Christian Democrat-Free Democrat coalition government&rdquo; gave an important anti-death penalty speech which endorsed &ldquo;the &lsquo;Burkean trusteeship&rsquo; model of political representation,&rdquo; where &ldquo;reason, informed by morality, finds its fullest expression during parliamentary deliberation.&rdquo; Quotes from the speech, which &ldquo;garnered stormy applause from the left, and was praised as an impressive success by a leading broadsheet,&rdquo; included phrases such as: &ldquo;I do not care about the &lsquo;people&rsquo;s conviction,&rsquo; that is, the opinion on the man on the street, when the question on the table is of the highest political and legal order.&rsquo;&rdquo; Hammel suggests that the context was important, in that &ldquo;the constituents represented by the parliamentarians to whom Dehler spoke had recently demonstrated their allegiance to one of the most brutal and sinister dictatorships in human history.&rdquo; On page 83, Hammel notes that Criminal Law Commission only had one member who &ldquo;argued at length that public opinion should be a principal factor in the Commission&rsquo;s deliberations&rdquo; on how to revise the Penal Code, though &ldquo;Skott, the tired judge assigned the task of delivering the principal speech on reintroduction, merely suggested that the legislature could not &lsquo;ignore&rsquo; the consistent and strong post-war majorities in favor of capital punishment.&rdquo; Likewise, British Member of Parliament Sydney Silverman argued against the Home Secretary that MPs &ldquo;are not delegates; we are not bound to ascertain exactly what a numerical majority of our constituents would wish and then to act accordingly without using our moral judgement. Edmund Burke long ago destroyed any such theory&hellip; Our business is to act accordingly to our consciences, honestly looking at the facts and coming to as right a judgement as we may.&rdquo; Of course, a collection of quotes from individual legislators does not make a conclusive case that this attitude was more prominent in Europe than the US.</span></p></div><div><p class="c0"><a href="#ftnt_ref643" id="ftnt643">[643]</a><span class="c1">&nbsp;Barbara Norrander, &ldquo;The multi-layered impact of public opinion on capital punishment implementation in the American states,&rdquo; </span><span class="c3 c1">Political Research Quarterly</span><span class="c4 c5 c1">&nbsp;53, no. 4 (2000), 771-93 found in path analysis using OLS regression that past execution rates and political culture (combining southern or nonsouthern states with moralistic or nonmoralistic culture; the variable construction is unclear) were significantly correlated with current sentencing rates.

The vast majority took place in Europe: 301, of which 135 were in Switzerland alone&hellip; There are two main reasons for this clear trend toward more referendums: first, the democratic revolutions in Eastern Europe led to no less than 27 new constitutions, the majority of which were approved by popular referendum; and second, the accelerated integration process within the European Union has launched a direct-democratic wave with transnational consequences.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c5 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c5 c1">However, on page 4, they evaluate the availability of initiatives and referendums [I&amp;R] in &ldquo;the European Convention (15 EU member states and 13 candidate states) and the four EFTA member states (Iceland, Norway, Liechtenstein and Switzerland).&rdquo; They asked: &ldquo;1. Do I&amp;R institutions and practices exist at the national level? 2. Are there I&amp;R institutions which can be launched by the citizens themselves, such as the popular initiative and the facultative referendum? 3. Are there provisions for obligatory referendums, such as are used in Denmark and Ireland for European questions? In only two instances, (Liechtenstein and Switzerland) was it possible to answer all three questions in the affirmative. There were three countries (Italy, Slovenia, and Latvia) in which citizens can initiative national referendums independently of parliament or the government, as well as four countries which have obligatory referendums (Ireland, Denmark, Lithuania, and Slovakia).

In parliamentary systems, people tend to vote for parties, which have more ideological variety, rather than for individuals. As a result, parties are less influenced by every reaction of the electorate, so that raw public opinion does not necessarily translate into legislative action. U.S. candidates are less insulated from populist impulses, and this feature of the U.S. political structure allows popular support for capital punishment to translate more easily and more directly into public policy.&rdquo;</span></p></div><div><p class="c0"><a href="#ftnt_ref673" id="ftnt673">[673]</a><span class="c1">&nbsp;Anthony McGann and Wayne Sandholtz, &ldquo;Patterns of death penalty abolition, 1960&ndash;2005: Domestic and international factors,&rdquo; </span><span class="c3 c1">International Studies Quarterly </span><span class="c4 c5 c1">56, no. 2 (2012), 282. Their models also suggest that the predominance of Catholicism in a country and the transition away from communism encouraged abolition, whereas the predominance of Protestantism and GDP per capita each had no significant effect. In the pre-1960 model, the predominance of Islam seems to have discouraged abolition. In the 1960 to 2005 model, Islam had no significant effect, though the sign was negative.

Hammel summarizes on page 217 that, &ldquo;European voters can exercise only gradual influence over the broad outlines of criminal justice policy, by voting for different political parties. However, because mainstream parties largely agree on the outlines of criminal justice policy, a change in power at the top will have little effect on day-to-day policy implementation. European voters have no power to replace lower level actors in the criminal justice bureaucracy, such as judges, district attorneys, or probation officers. Unlike voters in many American states, they cannot use referenda to pass criminal laws. They certainly do not have the power to dictate to judges how to interpret the law; this power would violate conceptions of judicial independence that are elemental to the understanding of law in civil-law nations.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c5 c1"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c1">Sangmin Bae, </span><span class="c3 c1">When The State No Longer Kills: International Human Rights Norms and Abolition of Capital Punishment </span><span class="c4 c5 c1">(New York: State University of New York Press, 2007), 101-5 makes some similar points, summarizing that, &ldquo;[t]wo major features of American political organization make the death penalty less receptive to international standards and more responsive to domestic populist impulse: federalism and electoral politics.&rdquo; Bae argues, for example, that the US &ldquo;is the only country that gives full criminal legislative power to individual federal units&hellip; the state-level domination of execution policy has inhibited the United State from joining the global trend toward abolition.&rdquo; The assumption behind the assertion of a causal relationship here is presumably that state-level institutions have less engagement with the international community and are less susceptible to such pressures.

On page 171, Hammel argues that &ldquo;the vocal support of right-wing parties for the return of the executioner helps to marginalize support for the issue overall. Of the millions of voters who say, in the abstract, that they might like to see the executioner return, only a fraction are so committed to this view that they will vote for a right-wing fringe party whose other policies they reject. Eventually, active support for the death penalty begins to be tainted by being primarily associated with right-wing demagogues, further undermining its appeal as a political motivating tool. This identification of capital punishment with the fringe right also spurs the increasing identification of opposition to capital punishment with progressive values. To borrow terminology from Pierre Bourdieu, opposition to capital punishment becomes one of the marks of &lsquo;distinction&rsquo; that persons use to signal their membership in the social elite.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c5 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c5 c1">Though this argument is plausible, it has little direct empirical support.

The log specification allows for decreasing marginal effects and corrects skewedness. To compute this variable, I create new data from the Yearbook of International Organizations published by the Union of International Associations from 1948 to 2009 (Union of International Associations, various years). I include only human rights INGOs, that is, those INGOs that have a local membership base in at least three different states and pursue the human rights recognized in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the ICCPR, and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights as their organizational aim.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c5 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c5 c1">Kim notes on pages 17-8 that this variable had a significant effect on the abolition of the death penalty for all crimes in all four tested models; an increase by one standard deviation from the mean resulted in an increase in the predicted hazard rate of abolition of 124%.

The Ukrainian institutional setting, autonomous and insulated from society, made it easier for political elites to bargain with international and domestic agents in abolishing capital punishment&hellip; In Ukraine&rsquo;s case, an ongoing series of monitoring sessions and peer-group persuasion helped the Ukrainian leaders acquire and improve a new understanding of the death penalty system. Perhaps most important, however, the learning/socialization process became more effective because of the material incentives involved. Had either of the two crucial elements&mdash;the continuing threats of expulsion from the Council of Europe and the efficiency of the persuasion process&mdash;been missing, Ukraine would have taken much longer to abolish the death penalty.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c5 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c5 c1">On pages 41-61, discussing South Africa, Bae emphasizes the role of international organizations less.

It was not a coincidence that the abolitionist movement emerged in the same year that the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights Aiming at the Abolition of the Death Penalty,&rdquo; though no evidence is provided that there was a causal link between these two events. Bae summarizes on page 73 that, &ldquo;[i]t was not until the late 1990s that the death penalty became a subject of public debates and the abolitionist cause started to gain public attention. The anti-death penalty movement gained strength through the leading roles of three actors: the religious community, Amnesty International and its Korean branch, and legislators.&rdquo; On page 81, Bae presents the lack of a &ldquo;conspicuous&rdquo; role of Korea&rsquo;s human rights organizations in the South Korean ADPM as one of several reasons why South Korea has implemented a moratorium but has not abolished the death penalty.</span></p></div><div><p class="c0"><a href="#ftnt_ref716" id="ftnt716">[716]</a><span class="c4 c5 c1">&nbsp;Stefanie Neumeier and Wayne Sandholtz, &ldquo;The Transnational Legal Ordering of the Death Penalty,&rdquo; </span><span class="c4 c3 c1">UC Irvine Journal of International, Transnational, and Comparative Law </span><span class="c4 c5 c1">4 (2019), 151-7.</span></p></div><div><p class="c0"><a href="#ftnt_ref717" id="ftnt717">[717]</a><span class="c1">&nbsp;Dongwook Kim, &ldquo;International Non-Governmental Organizations and the Abolition of the Death Penalty,&rdquo; </span><span class="c3 c1">European Journal of International Relations</span><span class="c4 c5 c1">&nbsp;22, no. 3 (2016), 5 summarizes that, &ldquo;[s]cholars have offered several explanations for why governments choose complete abolition.

They also wrote punishment-reform polemics stressing the dignity of the offender and decrying the brutality or inutility of existing punishment regimes. These idealistic appeals gradually influenced the bureaucratic/policy elite, although rarely to the point of winning them over to the most radical proposals. However, renowned intellectuals&rsquo; calls for complete abolition of capital punishment &lsquo;moved the goalposts&rsquo; of what sort of reforms it was acceptable to advocate in public. Thus, on both sides of the Atlantic, the 19th century saw progressive moves in three areas: (1) restricting capital punishment to only the most serious crimes; (2) transforming executions from public spectacles with a strong religious component into private, legalized ceremonies within prison walls; and (3) introducing execution techniques believed by policy-makers to be more humane. The dynamic unfolded roughly as follows: reformers would call for the outright abolition of capital punishment as a symbol of humanity and moral progress. Bureaucratic/policy elites &mdash; eager to don the mantle of moral progress, but unable or unwilling to abolish executions entirely &mdash; met the reformers halfway by &lsquo;civilizing&rsquo; the legal and physical procedures surrounding capital punishment. This pattern largely prevailed until after World War II.&rdquo;</span></p></div><div><p class="c0"><a href="#ftnt_ref744" id="ftnt744">[744]</a><span class="c4 c5 c1">&nbsp;See footnote 706.</span></p></div><div><p class="c0"><a href="#ftnt_ref745" id="ftnt745">[745]</a><span class="c1">&nbsp;Andrew Hammel, </span><span class="c3 c1">Ending the Death Penalty: The European Experience in Global Perspective </span><span class="c4 c5 c1">(Basingstoke, UK: Palgrave Macmillan, 2010), 14 notes that, &ldquo;[w]here abolition has not yet been achieved, there has been a movement, in line with Article 6(2) of the ICCPR, to restrict the number of crimes for which the penalty is death, to make it discretionary rather than mandatory (the latest country in the process of doing so being Barbados), and generally to restrict the number of people actually executed. Let me take two examples where there has yet to be a moratorium. The new Belarus Criminal Code of 1999 provides for death penalty for 15 fewer offences (in 14 rather than 29 articles) than the Code of 1960, and it can now only be imposed &lsquo;when it is dictated by special aggravating circumstances as well as an exceptional danger posed by the offender.&rsquo; Vietnam reduced the number of offences for which the death penalty can be imposed from 44 to 29 in 1999 and plans are in place to revise the Penal Code to reduce the number to 12, excluding economic crimes. China has yet to take this legislative leap.&rdquo;</span></p></div><div><p class="c0"><a href="#ftnt_ref746" id="ftnt746">[746]</a><span class="c1">&nbsp;Franklin E.

Because the death penalty symbolizes governmental willingness to employ ultimate power against those who threaten collective moral order, when a government relinquishes that power much of the public believes that society will be incapable of protecting itself. In reality, the death penalty is about as relevant to controlling violent crime as rain-dancing is to controlling the weather. So long as rain dances continue to be performed, as they have been since time immemorial, the belief that they have some influence on rainfall cannot be tested. When they cease to be performed, and the amount of precipitation remains unchanged in the subsequent years, the ritual&rsquo;s influence dissipates. Similarly, as time passes after abolition and increases in violent crime do not materialize, the felt necessity of the capital sanction diminishes gradually.&rdquo;</span></p></div><div><p class="c0"><a href="#ftnt_ref748" id="ftnt748">[748]</a><span class="c1">&nbsp;Franklin E.

They argue that, &ldquo;public opinion does change slowly over time. In 1962 the Council of Europe reported in relation to Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, Norway, and Sweden that &lsquo;there seems to be no question of capital punishment nowadays in any of those countries.&rsquo; In Sweden, the most recent public opinion poll revealed that twenty-eight percent of the respondents were for capital punishment, which the press described as an extraordinarily high proportion in favor of an &lsquo;outmoded punishment.&rsquo; In Norway a poll found seventy percent opposed the death penalty, fifteen percent favored, and fifteen percent had no opinion. In none of these countries had there been any public clamor for reintroducing the death penalty, or any significant struggle between those in favor and those against it. This is the common pattern in countries that have not executed for decades, and it is difficult to believe that it represents a political compromise. A more plausible conclusion would be that when a country has been abolitionist in practice for a number of years, controversy tends to end.&rdquo;</span></p></div><div><p class="c0"><a href="#ftnt_ref751" id="ftnt751">[751]</a><span class="c1">&nbsp;Roger Hood and Carolyn Hoyle, </span><span class="c3 c1">The Death Penalty: A Worldwide Perspective</span><span class="c4 c5 c1">&nbsp;(Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2015), 465-6. They also note that surveys have found young people tend to be less supportive of capital punishment in several countries, though since this does not appear to be specific to abolitionist countries, it does not seem to provide evidence that a lack of exposure to capital punishment reduces public support.</span></p></div><div><p class="c0"><a href="#ftnt_ref752" id="ftnt752">[752]</a><span class="c1">&nbsp;Jonathan Kelley and John Braithwaite, &ldquo;Public opinion and the death penalty in Australia,&rdquo; </span><span class="c3 c1">Justice Quarterly</span><span class="c4 c5 c1">&nbsp;7, no. 3 (1990), 529-63. They list several limitations of their methodology but note on page 551 that, &ldquo;[t]he elite leadership conclusion is buttressed, nevertheless, by the parallel analysis with support for stiffer sentences as the dependent variable (from Equation 2A). Abolishing capital punishment has absolutely no effect on support for stiffer sentences for criminals (Table 5, Line 19, Column 3). In this case a nonfinding strengthens a finding: if the elite leadership theory is right, then abolition of the death penalty should affect public support for the death penalty but not for other kinds of punishment on which the elite do not show leadership. On the other hand, if differences between states on the death penalty are an artifact of other differences (unknown and unmeasured in our model), we would expect to see similar apparent effects on the sentencing measure.&rdquo;</span></p></div><div><p class="c0"><a href="#ftnt_ref753" id="ftnt753">[753]</a><span class="c1">&nbsp;Steven Stack, &ldquo;Public Opinion on the Death Penalty,&rdquo; </span><span class="c3 c1">International Criminal Justice Review</span><span class="c4 c5 c1">&nbsp;14, no. 1 (2004), 69-98. On page 81, Stack explains that, &ldquo;[s]upport of the death penalty is first measured by the item &lsquo;People convicted of murder should be subject to the death penalty&rsquo; (1 = strongly disagree through 5 = strongly agree). This item is similar to the measure of death penalty support in the American General Social Survey (GSS): &lsquo;Do you favor or oppose the death penalty for a person convicted of murder?&rsquo;... The present study follows most previous research on death penalty support and measures death penalty support as a binary variable (0 or 1). Support for the death penalty (coded as 1) was measured by a response of &lsquo;strongly agree&rsquo; or &lsquo;mildly agree.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></p></div><div><p class="c0"><a href="#ftnt_ref754" id="ftnt754">[754]</a><span class="c1">&nbsp;John F.

All available evidence suggests that the majority of citizens living in abolitionist states at the end of the twentieth century would verbally support the notion of reinstating capital punishment.&rdquo;</span></p></div><div><p class="c0"><a href="#ftnt_ref755" id="ftnt755">[755]</a><span class="c1">&nbsp;John F.

If public opinion polls in abolitionist states accurately reflect support for the death penalty, it is reasonable to assume that significant numbers of politicians would use capital punishment as their ticket to political success. However, numerous interviews during the course of this study concluded that &lsquo;you cannot win on capital punishment in this state.&rsquo; How can this be true? There are two interconnected answers for this apparent contradiction. First, residents in abolitionist states have an opinion on capital punishment, but that opinion has little to do with their everyday lives. Under these circumstances, people vote for legislators and governors based on economic and other interests rather than on a candidate&rsquo;s death penalty position (for example, as in Wisconsin, North Dakota, and Minnesota). Second, those in abolitionist states tend to be abstractly supportive but practically opposed to the death penalty. In recent years, pro-death penalty legislators in Maine and Michigan, for example, have attempted to reestablish capital punishment by way of a referendum. Both efforts failed to get the necessary number of signatures to put the issue on the ballot.&rdquo;</span></p></div><div><p class="c0"><a href="#ftnt_ref756" id="ftnt756">[756]</a><span class="c1">&nbsp;For example, Andrew Hammel, </span><span class="c3 c1">Ending the Death Penalty: The European Experience in Global Perspective </span><span class="c4 c5 c1">(Basingstoke, UK: Palgrave Macmillan, 2010), 180-4 hypothesizes that critical coverage of George Bush&rsquo;s executions in the European media may have contributed to continued declines in public opinion.

In Germany, Thomas Dehler was the person most directly responsible for the maintenance of 1949&rsquo;s precarious constitutional ban on capital punishment, but renowned law professors such as Gustav Radbruch lent their support to the struggle. Also prominent were social-democratic jurists such as Carlo Schmid, (a lawyer with a doctoral title) who split his energies between serving as a regional chairman of the Social Democratic Party and as a professor of public law at the University of T&uuml;bingen; and Friedrich Wilhelm Wagner, who moved from legal practice into political opposition and ended his legal career as the Vice President of the Federal Constitutional Court. In France, Robert Badinter [an anti-death penalty litigator-turned-Minister for Justice] coordinated the final push for abolition with Fran&ccedil;ois Mitterand, and worked closely with other prominent advocates and politicians of a progressive cast. Badinter was in turn deeply influenced by Marc Ancel, a renowned French professor of comparative law. Ancel, commissioned by the Council of Europe, wrote an influential report n the death penalty in Europe in 1962, and elaborated the &lsquo;social defence&rsquo; theory of criminal law, in which the protection of human rights took precedence over the &lsquo;defence of society.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></p></div><div><p class="c0"><a href="#ftnt_ref826" id="ftnt826">[826]</a><span class="c4 c5 c1">&nbsp;See Jamie Harris, &ldquo;Social Movement Lessons From the US Prisoners&rsquo; Rights Movement&rdquo; (forthcoming).</span></p></div><div><p class="c0"><a href="#ftnt_ref827" id="ftnt827">[827]</a><span class="c4 c5 c1">&nbsp;See the paragraphs beginning &ldquo;A 2010 campaign by the UK group Reprieve&hellip;&rdquo; and &ldquo;Seemingly beginning in 2011&hellip;&rdquo; in &ldquo;A Condensed Chronological History of the US Anti-Death Penalty Movement.&rdquo;</span></p></div><div><p class="c0"><a href="#ftnt_ref828" id="ftnt828">[828]</a><span class="c1">&nbsp;Mary D.

The specific historical context leading to abolition differed from nation to nation,&rdquo; but &ldquo;[t]he idea of total abolition was pioneered by public intellectuals and philosophers, and then gradually gained in popularity among the educated upper classes, especially the liberal professions. Once support for the abolition of capital punishment reached a &lsquo;critical mass&rsquo; among the educated elite, legislative proposals to abolish capital punishment were tabled, generally by lawmakers in a national assembly. In fact, the final phases of all three abolition movements were managed largely by individual lawmakers: Thomas Dehler in Germany, Sydney Silverman in Great Britain, and Robert Badinter in France. In all three countries, perhaps the chief obstacle to abolition was public support for capital punishment. These abolition movements prevailed not by changing public opinion, but rather by shielding the capital punishment issue from the vagaries of the public mood and stiffening the spines of legislators who privately disdained the death penalty but feared a public backlash if they voted to abolish it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c5 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c5 c1">For example, on page 141-3, Hammel describes how, despite growing public support for the death penalty, presidential candidate Fran&ccedil;ois Mitterand promised to abolish the death penalty if he was elected. Upon his election, Mitterand appointed an anti-death penalty litigator, Robert Badinter, as Justice Minister. The National Assembly was given a free vote on the issue; the result was 333 votes for abolition compared to 117 against, though the result was narrower in the Senate (160 to 126).</span></p></div><div><p class="c0"><a href="#ftnt_ref868" id="ftnt868">[868]</a><span class="c1">&nbsp;See the section &ldquo;1972-86: Backlash, legal reversal through </span><span class="c3 c1">Gregg v.

The study by Vidmar and Dittenhoffer (1981) improved the validity of the experimental manipulation in Sarat and Vidmar (1976) by increasing the opportunity for subjects to assimilate information about the death penalty. In the study by Vidmar and Dittenhoffer (1981), subjects were asked to read a 3500 word essay on the death penalty (emphasizing the Canadian experience), and a series of eight articles. The articles contained representative material on the death penalty intended to augment the essay.&rdquo; Participants were also given the opportunity to discuss their findings with each other. &ldquo;On the pretest, 48 percent of the experimental subjects favored the death penalty, 33 percent were opposed to it, and 19 percent were undecided.

The classes took place between the years 1985 and 1989. When asked whether they favored the death penalty for &ldquo;some people convicted of first-degree murder,&rdquo; 28% of &ldquo;less informed subjects [that is, students who had not yet received the additional classes] opposed the death penalty,&rdquo; compared to 49% of &ldquo;more informed subjects.&rdquo; One of the &ldquo;concrete&rdquo; questions asked was: &ldquo;If asked to do it, could you pull the lever that would result in the death of an individual convicted of first-degree murder?&rdquo; This was the only question that saw little difference between less and more informed subjects, with 47.2% and 49.6% respectively answering that they could not do it. However, the wording of this question seems to introduce some irrelevant questions that limit the usefulness of this finding; did they interpret &ldquo;could&rdquo; to mean physical capability? And upon what authority were they being instructed to do this? Although Bohm reports these results as mixed, the author interprets this as evidence that the increase in information did lead to increased hostility to the death penalty. A semester&rsquo;s worth of content on the topic seems unlikely to have represented an impartial increase in the students&rsquo; knowledge, given that Bohm (who conducted the study) seems to be critical of the death penalty and given that Bedau&rsquo;s book was assigned as required reading.</span></p></div><div><p class="c0"><a href="#ftnt_ref893" id="ftnt893">[893]</a><span class="c1">&nbsp;Phoebe C.

This was a most unlikely social movement and indeed was more focused within a certain community of activists and student legal clinics than within a broad community of activists, as in the civil rights movement for example. There were no national protests, no mass demonstrations (though there were a few small ones in individual states).

They note on page 191 that, &ldquo;there was one period &mdash; the second quarter of 1990 &mdash; in which there were sixteen more pro- than anti-death penalty stories in the </span><span class="c3 c1">New York Times</span><span class="c4 c5 c1">. Similarly, in the second quarter of 2001, there were forty-three more anti- than pro-death penalty stories. So there is quite a lot of movement; net tone, in fact, ranged from +16 to -43, or a swing of almost sixty points. Based on the estimates reported in Table 6.1, we can calculate the equilibrium or expected value of public opinion for each case, holding the number of homicides constant at 5,000, its approximate mean quarterly value over the full period (homicides numbered nearly 6,000 in 1990 and dipped below 4,000 in 2001). The equilibrium value of public opinion given sixteen pro-death penalty stories and 5,000 homicides is given by the long-run equation in in column I, substituting values of net tone and homicides into the equation: 8.95 + (0.149 x 16) + (3.41 x 5) = 28.38, for a net a pro-death penalty opinion heavily in favor of capital punishment. Compare this with the equilibrium value of opinion associated with a net tone of -43 assuming the same 5,000 homicides. Now the equilibrium level of opinion is given by 8.95 + (0.149 x -43) + (3.41 x 5) = 19.59. In just over a decade, the equilibrium value of public opinion shifted by 8.79 percentage points. Although in both periods death penalty supporters outnumber opponents, the public opinion altered dramatically. These are strong effects indeed.&rdquo; A similar calculation is conducted for homicides.</span></p></div><div><p class="c0"><a href="#ftnt_ref938" id="ftnt938">[938]</a><span class="c1">&nbsp;Frank R.

On page 198 they suggest that the larger effects of net tone on sentencing rates are because &ldquo;[c]hange comes quicker when the question moves from the theoretical to the individual, and there is reason to expect that the innocence frame would have its greatest impact here. Many could truthfully say they support the death penalty in response to a generically worded survey question, but not impose it in a case before them because of doubts about the perfection of the system.&rdquo; On page 201 they conclude that the results &ldquo;provide strong support for the social cascade model.

The manner of transmission, however, is clear. A prominent intellectual, academic or write (Hugo, Thackray, Mittermaier, and many lesser lights) penned a compelling presentation of the abolitionist program, inspiring discussion of the subject in educated circles. A solid minority of elite members committed to the cause of complete abolition would gradually build. These abolitionists formed organizations devoted to advancing the cause, thus creating a more or less permanent focus for the abolitionist viewpoint and ensuring the continuous production of abolitionist polemics and analyses. One consistent theme of abolitionist discourse, as we have seen, is claiming the high ground of &lsquo;progressive,&rsquo; &lsquo;civilized,&rsquo; and &lsquo;humane&rsquo; values. Opposition to the death penalty thus gradually established itself as one of the signature issues by which social progressives recognized one another. Nowhere was this trend more firmly established than among the liberal professions, and among those, the lawyers. The death penalty is regulated within the legal system, and many of the arguments against capital punishment are well tailored to the logical, rationalistic style of analysis taught in all law schools.&rdquo;</span></p></div><div><p class="c0"><a href="#ftnt_ref943" id="ftnt943">[943]</a><span class="c4 c5 c1">&nbsp;See the strategic implication &ldquo;Once influential international bodies adopt a value, they may exert pressure on institutions in other parts of the world to adopt the same value.&rdquo;</span></p></div><div><p class="c0"><a href="#ftnt_ref944" id="ftnt944">[944]</a><span class="c1">&nbsp;This is an assumption of the author.

In 1872, the </span><span class="c3 c1">Des Moines Register </span><span class="c1">launched a campaign against capital punishment, arguing it was both &lsquo;uncivilized and impossible to enforce.&rsquo; That year the death penalty was abolished by a margin of fifty-four to twenty-one in the Iowa house and thirty-one to fourteen in the Iowa Senate.&rdquo; Following lynchings, however, the death penalty was reinstated in 1878. They describe on pages 175-8 the </span><span class="c3 c1">Register&rsquo;s </span><span class="c1">favorable coverage of Democratic Governor Harold Hughes&rsquo; efforts to abolish the death penalty. This is not clear evidence that the </span><span class="c3 c1">Register </span><span class="c4 c5 c1">had much effect on the passage of legislation in Iowa, however.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c5 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Likewise, they provide evidence on pages 193-202 that the </span><span class="c3 c1">Charleston Gazette </span><span class="c1">was always &ldquo;adamantly opposed to capital punishment,&rdquo; but provide no substantial evidence for the claim that, &ldquo;[t]his powerful newspaper was a force in the abolition of the death penalty and, more recently, a force in its maintenance,&rdquo; beyond a quote from the chief counsel to the House Judiciary Committee: &ldquo;politicians fear the </span><span class="c3 c1">Gazette</span><span class="c4 c5 c1">&mdash;by far the best newspaper in the state.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c5 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c5 c1">On pages 20-3, the authors provide a number of other examples of where anti-death penalty media coverage may have contributed to the maintenance of abolition in certain states. For example, after describing the negative portrayals of death penalty supporters among the press in Michigan, they provide evidence that, &ldquo;very few Michigan legislators actively support capital punishment bills&rdquo; and suggest that this is because of the &ldquo;negative connotations&rdquo; emphasized by the press.</span></p></div><div><p class="c0"><a href="#ftnt_ref946" id="ftnt946">[946]</a><span class="c4 c5 c1">&nbsp;Jamie Harris, &ldquo;Social Movement Lessons From the US Anti-Abortion Movement&rdquo; (November 26, 2019), https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/anti-abortion.</span></p></div></body></html>
