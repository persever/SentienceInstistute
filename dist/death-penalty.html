<meta name="citation_abstract" content="This report aims to assess (1) the extent to which the anti-death penalty movement in the United States, especially from 1966-2015, can be said to have successfully achieved its goals, (2) what factors caused the various successes and failures of this movement, and (3) what these findings suggest about how modern social movements should strategize. The analysis highlights the farmed animal movement as an illustrative example of the strategic implications for a variety of movements. Key findings of this report include that a narrow focus on legal strategies can discourage the growth of a grassroots movement that may be more effective in the longer term and that legislative change is possible without public support.">

Its advocates therefore support, at least in part, an expansion of the moral circle to encompass convicted criminals, in the sense that they would share the right-to-life of non-convicts. Although there are important differences between the ADPM and farmed animal movement, there is a fundamental similarity between them: Advocates from both movements believe that the sentient beings they seek to protect are granted insufficient consideration, protection, or rights and that it is worth investing time and resources into securing more consideration, protection, or rights for them. Other features that affect the ADPM&rsquo;s comparability with the farmed animal movement are listed </span><span class="c18"><a class="c16" href="#h.2bn6wsx">below</a></span><span>, but overall it seems that we can glean some strategic insight from the ADPM suitable for effective animal advocacy&mdash;that is, </span><span class="c34">evidence on which animal advocacy strategies are most effective</span><span>.</span><sup class="c2"><a href="#ftnt1" id="ftnt_ref1">[1]</a></sup></p><p class="c9 c6"><span class="c4 c7 c5"></span></p><p class="c9"><span>As with Sentience Institute&rsquo;s case study of the US anti-abortion movement, </span><span class="c3">this report makes no attempt to evaluate the goals of either movement. This report is exclusively about the strategy of social movements, and while we will discuss goals insofar as they are relevant to strategic discussion, we deliberately avoid any moral assessment.</span><sup class="c2"><a href="#ftnt2" id="ftnt_ref2">[2]</a></sup></p><p class="c9 c6"><span class="c4 c7 c5"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4 c7 c5">This report provides a condensed history of the US ADPM with a focus on the 1960s to the present. For comparison, ADPMs in other countries are also considered briefly. After providing this history, the report draws tentative conclusions about which strategies seemed to be most effective for the ADPM and suggests potential implications for social movement strategy. The focus of this report is on strategic insights for the farmed animal movement, but some insights may be useful for other movements as well.</span></p><p class="c9 c6"><span class="c4 c7 c5"></span></p><p class="c9"><span>The focus on the US ADPM, rather than on ADPMs in other countries or the broader US prisoners&rsquo; rights movement (which includes other goals of prisoner benefit, e.g. better living conditions), was principally due to the greater availability of research and evidence from sociologists, legal scholars, historians, and political scientists. However, compared to the US focus of SI&rsquo;s case study of the anti-abortion movement,</span><sup class="c2"><a href="#ftnt3" id="ftnt_ref3">[3]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;it seemed especially worthwhile to incorporate at least some international comparison on the US ADPM, given that the US has retained the death penalty while 105 other countries have abolished its use.</span><sup class="c2"><a href="#ftnt4" id="ftnt_ref4">[4]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;Europe is an especially important comparator because, since the 1970s, around half of the countries that have abolished capital punishment for all crimes have been European countries.</span><sup class="c2"><a href="#ftnt5" id="ftnt_ref5">[5]</a></sup></p><p class="c9 c6"><span class="c4 c7 c5"></span></p><p class="c9"><span>This report was mainly undertaken as exploratory analysis rather than being designed to test explicit hypotheses regarding strategic effectiveness. Nevertheless, the author hoped that the report would provide evidence for or against the claims regarding effective strategy made in SI&rsquo;s previous two social movement case studies</span><sup class="c2"><a href="#ftnt6" id="ftnt_ref6">[6]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;and would provide strategic insight into the foundational questions in effective animal advocacy.</span><sup class="c2"><a href="#ftnt7" id="ftnt_ref7">[7]</a></sup><span class="c4 c7 c5">&nbsp;As was the case at the start of the author&rsquo;s research into the US anti-abortion movement, the author believed that the US ADPM had mostly failed at achieving its goals and therefore that this report would provide evidence that, on average, the tactics used by the US ADPM should be avoided by the farmed animal movement.</span></p><p class="c9 c6"><span class="c4 c7 c5"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4 c7 c5">In several other ways, this report borrows much of the methodology and framing of SI&rsquo;s previous two social movement case studies.</span></p><p class="c9 c6"><span class="c4 c7 c5"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4 c7 c5">This report uses the terms capital punishment and death penalty interchangeably, although sometimes it is necessary to distinguish between those sentenced to death and those who are actually executed. Likewise, unless otherwise specified, the terms convict, criminal, and prisoner are used interchangeably, since these groups almost completely overlap&nbsp;in the context of this report. This usage is not intended to deny that some criminals are never convicted or that some prisoners have been wrongly convicted. Unless otherwise specified, the term ADPM is used to encompass both advocates of the total abolition of capital punishment and advocates of a national or statewide moratorium (suspension) on executions, even though some advocates of a moratorium may not support a permanent ban. De jure (legally enforced) abolition is sometimes distinguished from de facto abolition, where executions have ceased in practice but have not been legally banned.

For example:</span></p><ul class="c15 lst-kix_list_46-0 start"><li class="c9 c10"><span class="c4 c7 c5">A more detailed analysis of the legal history of the US ADPM could provide more actionable insights for the judicial strategy of advocates seeking to secure rights for animals, such as through legal personhood.</span></li><li class="c9 c10"><span class="c4 c7 c5">Interviews with anti-death penalty advocates and their opponents or surveys of the current US population could lead to further insights and provide evidence on questions more specifically tailored to the interests of the farmed animal movement.</span></li><li class="c9 c10"><span class="c4 c7 c5">A systematic check through the annual reports of all identifiable anti-death penalty organizations could be informative, if they are accessible.</span></li><li class="c9 c10"><span class="c4 c7 c5">Are there important contributions in the historical and social scientific literature on the US ADPM that I have not included here?</span></li></ul><p class="c9 c6"><span class="c4 c7 c5"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4 c7 c5">Many of the strategic implications from this report could be further analyzed in the context of other social movements. For example:</span></p><ul class="c15 lst-kix_list_41-0 start"><li class="c9 c10"><span class="c4 c7 c5">Has legislation that was contrary to public opinion at the time of its implementation encouraged a shift in public opinion and prioritization in the long-term?</span></li><li class="c9 c10"><span class="c4 c7 c5">Have professionalization and shifts towards legal strategies caused problems for other movements?</span></li><li class="c9 c10"><span class="c4 c7 c5">Has the tactic of suspending a practice while awaiting further research been effective in other contexts?</span></li><li class="c9 c10"><span class="c4 c7 c5">Do procedural reforms of the practices and institutions targeted by other social movements seem to have legitimated those practices or institutions by making them seem more humane than is the case in practice?</span></li></ul><h1 class="c39" id="h.1v1yuxt"><span class="c4 c5 c35">Selected Bibliography</span></h1><p class="c0"><span>Acker, James R., Robert M.
