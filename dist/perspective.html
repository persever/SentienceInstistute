At the most basic level, Sentience Institute thinks of the moral circle as a series of concentric circles, as shown in Figure 1. Entities in the </span><span class="c5">inner circle</span><span>&nbsp;are granted full moral consideration: their interests are fully taken into account in moral decision-making. Entities in the </span><span class="c5">outer circle</span><span>&nbsp;are granted a moderate level of moral consideration, but their interests are devalued relative to those in the inner circle. At the </span><span class="c5">frontiers of the circle</span><span>, entities are granted minimal moral consideration, and those </span><span class="c5">outside of the circle</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;are granted no moral consideration at all. Any entities can be included in this model, such as humans, animals, robots, and ecosystems.</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c24"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 431.15px; height: width/0.933;"><img alt="" src="images/perspective/image1.png" style="width: 431.15px; height: width/0.933; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Figure 1: </span><span>The Moral Circle. This conceptualization draws on </span><span class="c6"><a class="c2" href="https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2016-01230-001.html">Crimston et al. (2018)</a></span><span>.</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>We can distinguish between several conceptions of the moral circle. We can consider a person&rsquo;s </span><span class="c5">attitudinal</span><span>, or </span><span class="c5">self-reported</span><span>, moral circle &mdash; what they think their moral circle should look like, and their </span><span class="c5">behavioral</span><span>, or </span><span class="c5">choice-based</span><span>, moral circle &mdash; how they treat other entities. We can also distinguish between an individual&rsquo;s </span><span class="c5">personal</span><span>&nbsp;moral circle &mdash; how they personally act (or think they should act) towards different entities, and the </span><span class="c5">societal</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;moral circle &mdash; how society as a whole treats different entities, or how people think society should treat different entities. Moreover, in most conceptions, it is not a circle per se. It spans across many dimensions and has holes and protrusions, such as apparently distant groups that are given uniquely high moral concern, and gradients rather than distinct categories of concern. Consider, for example, the treatment of Bald Eagles in the U.S., where they are a national bird and symbol, despite birds generally being on the frontiers or outside of the moral circle.</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>At Sentience Institute, we are mainly interested in the societal moral circle. This captures the laws, policies, and norms that are intended to protect the interests of different entities. We envision a society where all </span><span class="c6"><a class="c2" href="https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/blog/what-is-sentience">sentient beings</a></span><span class="c7">, that is, beings with the capacity for positive and negative experiences, are included in the inner moral circle. Note that this does not mean we think all sentient entities should be treated in exactly the same way. Different entities have different interests. Being in the inner circle means an entity&rsquo;s specific set of interests are given full moral consideration, not that they are treated in exactly the same way as others in the circle.</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Currently, society&rsquo;s moral circle looks quite different from our vision of all sentient beings in the inner circle. The actual moral circle spans across many dimensions other than sentience. For example, society grants moral consideration based on factors such as an entity&rsquo;s location in space, their location in time, their species, their substrate, whether their experience is the result of an act or an omission, the cause of the entity&rsquo;s experience, and what an entity is believed to deserve.</span><sup class="c23"><a href="#ftnt1" id="ftnt_ref1">[1]</a></sup><span class="c7"> Intrinsically, Sentience Institute considers all of these factors to be irrelevant, though there may be instrumental reasons to care about some of them if doing so would benefit sentient beings.</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>We describe the moral circle and its prioritization in more detail in our 2021 paper in the journal </span><span class="c5">Futures, </span><span class="c6"><a class="c2" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016328721000641#bib0185">"Moral Circle Expansion: A Promising Strategy to Impact the Far Future."</a></span></p><h1 class="c10" id="h.1fob9te"><span class="c21 c19">Effective Altruism</span></h1><p class="c1"><span>How should we approach the task of expanding society&rsquo;s moral circle to include all sentient beings? At Sentience Institute, we apply the principles of </span><span class="c6"><a class="c2" href="https://www.effectivealtruism.org/">effective altruism</a></span><span class="c7">&nbsp;to help us answer this question. Effective altruism aims to generate the most positive impact with the available resources. Ideally, we would help all sentient beings that need it right away, but in reality, resources are scarce and we must make decisions about how to allocate them.</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Having the largest impact with our resources requires us to define what we mean by &ldquo;impact.&rdquo; Sentience Institute is focused on the </span><span class="c6"><a class="c2" href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/well-being/">wellbeing</a></span><span>&nbsp;of sentient entities. We take a broadly </span><span class="c6"><a class="c2" href="https://www.utilitarianism.net/">utilitarian</a></span><span>&nbsp;approach. Still, we think that an important way of respecting the interests of sentient beings is by recognizing them as legal persons, such as the endowment of legal rights and standing. This has been one of the main methods of moral circle expansion for humans; we&rsquo;ve seen this with the </span><span class="c6"><a class="c2" href="https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/british-antislavery">abolition of slavery</a></span><span>, the </span><span class="c6"><a class="c2" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_labour">passage of child labor laws</a></span><span>, the </span><span class="c6"><a class="c2" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women%27s_suffrage">franchisement of women</a></span><span class="c7">, and many more important social movements. In each of these cases, the granting of legal rights greatly increased wellbeing, and it would likely do so for nonhuman sentient beings as well.</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>An important view associated with effective altruism is </span><span class="c0"><a class="c2" href="https://globalprioritiesinstitute.org/hilary-greaves-william-macaskill-the-case-for-strong-longtermism-2/">longtermism</a></span><span>, that vast amounts of moral value exists in the long run, so we ought to take steps to ensure that it goes as well as possible. In practice, this often involves working to reduce </span><span class="c0"><a class="c2" href="https://www.nickbostrom.com/existential/risks.html">existential risk</a></span><span> &mdash; x-risks. Given the size of the long-term future, and the potential for humanity&rsquo;s expansion beyond earth, a particularly important consideration is </span><span class="c6"><a class="c2" href="https://centerforreducingsuffering.org/intro/">s-risks</a></span><span>&nbsp;&mdash; risks of astronomical suffering, on a scale far exceeding anything that currently exists on earth today. Preventing s-risks is an important priority from the perspective of </span><span class="c6"><a class="c2" href="https://longtermrisk.org/the-case-for-suffering-focused-ethics/">suffering-focused ethics</a></span><span class="c7">. At Sentience Institute, we take a longtermist perspective on moral circle expansion, prioritizing the wellbeing of sentient entities in the long run rather than the next few months or years, with a particular focus on avoiding extremely negative outcomes.</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Finally, we are concerned with our </span><span class="c5">expected </span><span>impact. Since the benefits we hope to create lie in the future, which is necessarily uncertain, we consider the right actions to be the ones that are most likely to bring about those benefits. In practice, calculating how to have the largest expected impact over the long run is largely infeasible. Rather than carrying out such calculations explicitly, we tend to rely on heuristics, such as the </span><span class="c6"><a class="c2" href="https://concepts.effectivealtruism.org/concepts/importance-neglectedness-tractability/">scale, neglectedness, and tractability</a></span><span class="c7">&nbsp;of a problem, which is common in effective altruism.</span></p><h1 class="c10" id="h.3znysh7"><span class="c19 c21">Promising Cause Areas</span></h1><p class="c1"><span class="c7">Within the general project of moral circle expansion, the following frontiers of the moral circle seem particularly important as cause areas. </span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c7"></span></p><h2 class="c18" id="h.2et92p0"><span class="c16">Farmed Animals</span></h2><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>There are over 100 billion land animals on farms right now, and the overwhelming majority &mdash; </span><span class="c0"><a class="c2" href="https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/us-factory-farming-estimates">99% in the US</a></span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span class="c0"><a class="c2" href="https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/global-animal-farming-estimates">over 90% globally</a></span><span>&nbsp;&mdash; are crowded in inhumane facilities known as &ldquo;factory farms.&rdquo; The intensive confinement of animals on these farms leads to </span><span class="c6"><a class="c2" href="https://www.humanesociety.org/sites/default/files/docs/hsus-report-welfare-egg-industry.pdf">a</a></span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c0"><a class="c2" href="https://www.humanesociety.org/sites/default/files/docs/hsus-report-pig-industry-welfare.pdf">range</a></span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c0"><a class="c2" href="https://www.humanesociety.org/sites/default/files/docs/hsus-report-animal-welfare-aquaculture-industry.pdf">of</a></span><span>&nbsp;psychological and physical health problems, and </span><span class="c0"><a class="c2" href="http://www.humanesociety.org/assets/pdfs/farm/mortality_cage_free.pdf">many of these animals</a></span><span>&nbsp;endure painful deaths on account of health complications caused by their breeding or environment.

While there are some laws in place to protect their interests, society has a long way to go before farmed animals are granted full moral circle inclusion. Moreover, attention to farmed animal welfare is highly neglected &mdash; even when we only consider the limited resources that society directs to nonhuman animal issues, a </span><span class="c6"><a class="c2" href="https://animalcharityevaluators.org/blog/why-farmed-animals/">small proportion</a></span><span class="c7">&nbsp;goes towards farmed animals. Practically, addressing this issue is relatively tractable &mdash; we can pass laws and policies, influence social norms to reduce meat consumption, and create animal-free food products, all of which tend to reduce the suffering of farmed animals.</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>While we are most concerned about the scale and intensity of suffering involved on factory farms, we favor the full transition away from animal farming to a completely animal-free food system. This is for several reasons, including the fact that so-called &ldquo;humane&rdquo; farms often still cause significant harm to nonhuman animals. Further discussion on the case against &ldquo;humane&rdquo; farming can be found in a </span><span class="c0"><a class="c2" href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2018/nov/16/theres-no-such-thing-as-humane-meat-or-eggs-stop-kidding-yourself">book excerpt</a></span><span>&nbsp;in </span><span class="c5">The Guardian</span><span>, and a more general discussion of the problems of and solutions to animal farming can be found in our book, </span><span class="c0 c5"><a class="c2" href="http://jacyanthis.com/book">The End of Animal Farming</a></span><span class="c7">.</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c7"></span></p><h2 class="c18" id="h.tyjcwt"><span class="c16">Wild Animals and Invertebrates</span></h2><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>While the number of farmed animals in existence is in the hundreds of billions &mdash; an incomprehensibly large number to intuitively grasp &mdash; the </span><span class="c6"><a class="c2" href="https://reducing-suffering.org/how-many-wild-animals-are-there/">number of wild animals</a></span><span>&nbsp;in existence is orders of magnitude larger with wild birds and mammals in the trillions and insects potentially in the quintillions. Humans </span><span class="c6"><a class="c2" href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/">tend</a></span><span>&nbsp;to grant consideration to only highly charismatic animals in the wild, such as pandas, elephants, and blue whales, or show concern only through more abstract categories such as species, ecosystems, and habitats. Concern for the wellbeing of less charismatic wild animals as individuals with their own set of interests, however, is highly limited. This may be due to the sheer number of wild animals in existence, as well as an </span><span class="c6"><a class="c2" href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281535446_Debunking_the_idyllic_view_of_natural_processes_Population_dynamics_and_suffering_in_the_wild">idealized vision</a></span><span class="c7">&nbsp;of life in the wild that does not take into account the widespread existence of illness, hunger, predation, and other natural causes of suffering. Since we at Sentience Institute care about the wellbeing of sentient beings, the widespread existence of suffering in the nature raises the question of what can be done about it.</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>This topic has been receiving greater attention in academia and from nonprofit organizations in recent years, and a </span><span class="c6"><a class="c2" href="https://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/relations3&div=4&id=&page=">healthy discourse</a></span><span>&nbsp;has emerged. Given the complexity and interconnected nature of ecosystems, any attempt to intervene with the goal of benefiting wild animals can easily lead to unintended consequences. Much of the current work, therefore, is focused on gaining a better understanding of the issues at stake, and in some cases carrying out small scale interventions, such as administering </span><span class="c6"><a class="c2" href="https://www.wildanimalinitiative.org/blog/pigeon-contraception">contraceptives</a></span><span class="c7">&nbsp;to manage resource availability, to understand the effects on wild animals&rsquo; lives.</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Sentience Institute does not currently have specific research projects on wild animal suffering, though we may in the future.

Various authors have proposed the possibility of </span><span class="c6"><a class="c2" href="https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/blog/the-importance-of-artificial-sentience">artificial sentience</a></span><span>&nbsp;&mdash; that is, sentient beings whose minds are instantiated in digital substrates. For example, Holden Karnofsky </span><span class="c6"><a class="c2" href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/AKxKR4CeakyBsGFoH/digital-people-would-be-an-even-bigger-deal">discusses</a></span><span>&nbsp;the possibility of &ldquo;digital people,&rdquo; and Carl Shulman and Nick Bostrom </span><span class="c6"><a class="c2" href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Sharing-the-World-with-Digital-Minds-Shulman-Bostrom/60062c122c73c7cf7967b240d14b5a9aafa29a12">discuss</a></span><span class="c7">&nbsp;&ldquo;digital minds.&rdquo; While this may seem like a farfetched concern, particularly given the scale and intensity of suffering that exists on the planet today, there are several reasons to take the possibility seriously.</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>First, there is a trend towards increasingly advanced artificial intelligence. This is due in part to increasing </span><span class="c6"><a class="c2" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law">computer power</a></span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span class="c6"><a class="c2" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data">data availability</a></span><span>, which means that increasingly </span><span class="c6"><a class="c2" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning">complex learning algorithms</a></span><span>&nbsp;are being developed and used to solve a growing range of social problems, and due to groups such as OpenAI and DeepMind trying to create of artificial general intelligence. Future artificial entities may have features that we typically associate with sentience, and in some cases, this is an </span><span class="c6"><a class="c2" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frobt.2019.00017/full">explicit goal</a></span><span>. The nature of digital entities &mdash; the ease with which they can be </span><span class="c6"><a class="c2" href="https://philpapers.org/archive/SOTAOA.pdf">created and copied</a></span><span>, for instance &mdash; makes it possible that they will be created in </span><span class="c6"><a class="c2" href="https://longtermrisk.org/risks-of-astronomical-future-suffering/#Sentient_simulations">extremely large numbers</a></span><span class="c7">. There is also reason to think these entities may not be fully included in humanity&rsquo;s moral circle, particularly because while some artificial entities may have humanlike features, others are likely to be quite different to humans and thus prone to exclusion as many nonhuman animals are today.</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>This could lead to their mistreatment, either </span><span class="c6"><a class="c2" href="https://centerforreducingsuffering.org/a-typology-of-s-risks/#Incidental_s-risks">incidentally</a></span><span>, because their interests are not given sufficient attention, or </span><span class="c6"><a class="c2" href="https://centerforreducingsuffering.org/a-typology-of-s-risks/#Agential_s-risks">deliberately</a></span><span>, as a result of the actions of malevolent agents.

While we consider artificial sentience to be a key risk from a longtermist perspective, we also think it is important to consider future generations of beings more generally, such as humans and non-human animals, given that they are also largely excluded from humanity&rsquo;s current moral circle. From a longtermist perspective, we should not only take into account the wellbeing of the next few generations of beings, but of all future generations.</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>There are a range of risks that may affect the wellbeing of all sorts of future beings, such as climate change, nuclear war, and pandemics. Again, </span><span class="c6"><a class="c2" href="https://longtermrisk.org/artificial-intelligence-and-its-implications-for-future-suffering">artificial intelligence</a></span><span class="c7">&nbsp;has the potential to radically transform society over the next few decades or centuries. The specifics of such a transformation are uncertain, but society&rsquo;s future institutions, including those affecting its moral circle, could be determined by the goals and values that are specified, either correctly or incorrectly, in very powerful AI. For a discussion of strategies to affect the long-term future see our 2018 Effective Altruism Forum post, </span><span class="c6"><a class="c2" href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/BY8gXSpGijypbGitT/why-i-prioritize-moral-circle-expansion-over-artificial">"Why I Prioritize Moral Circle Expansion over Artificial Intelligence Alignment."</a></span></p><h1 class="c10" id="h.4d34og8"><span class="c21 c19">Our Approach and Theory of Change</span></h1><p class="c1"><span>At Sentience Institute, we approach moral circle expansion through research. The research we conduct is interdisciplinary, particularly across economics, history, philosophy, psychology, and sociology. We focus on empirical questions, such as how the moral circle has expanded </span><span class="c6"><a class="c2" href="https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/british-antislavery">historically</a></span><span>, what people&rsquo;s moral circles look like </span><span class="c6"><a class="c2" href="https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/aft-survey-2020">today</a></span><span>, and the </span><span class="c6"><a class="c2" href="https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/afft-experiment">factors</a></span><span>&nbsp;that influence people&rsquo;s moral circles, but also work on some conceptual questions to clarify concepts such as </span><span class="c6"><a class="c2" href="https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/blog/what-is-sentience">sentience</a></span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span class="c6"><a class="c2" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016328721000641">moral circle expansion</a></span><span class="c7">. Historically, we have focused on farmed animals; we now allocate a substantial proportion of our resources to address questions related to artificial sentience.</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Our research has many different routes to impact, often referred to as the </span><span class="c6"><a class="c2" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_change">&ldquo;Theory of Change.&rdquo;</a></span><span>&nbsp;Most directly, we aim to discover the factors (e.g., activism and business strategies) that most lead to moral circle expansion, </span><span class="c13">but we also aim to understand the nature of moral progress (e.g., How do more people become longtermist?) and evaluate the extent to which certain moral and social outcomes should be prioritized by those trying to do the most good (i.e., </span><span class="c6 c14"><a class="c2" href="https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/global-priorities-research/">&ldquo;global priorities research&rdquo;</a></span><span class="c13">)</span><span>. This helps activists, donors, investors, governments, firms, and other stakeholders working on these issues knowledge to implement strategies that will change social norms and implement more morally inclusive laws and policies. While we mainly focus on </span><span class="c6"><a class="c2" href="https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/blog/institutional-tactics">institutional change</a></span><span class="c7">, we expect our research will also help organizations working on changing individual behavior. Because of our longtermist perspective, we are interested in helping develop social movements and organizations that can take action many years from now.</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">Where appropriate, we publish our research in academic journals, which helps communicate our findings to academics and encourages other researchers to carry out similar research. Our research sometimes attracts media attention, which we expect also has positive effects by informing public opinion and promoting more morally inclusive social norms. Usually, stakeholders see our research via email or directly on our website.</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">Figure 2 summarizes this Theory of Change, how we expect our research to lead to the expansion of society&rsquo;s moral circle to include greater numbers of sentient beings.</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 898.95px; height: width/1.67;"><img alt="" src="images/perspective/image2.png" style="width: 898.95px; height: width/1.67; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Figure 2: </span><span>Sentience Institute&rsquo;s Theory of Change.
