The analysis highlights strategic implications for a variety of movements, especially those focused on moral circle expansion. Key findings of this report include that engaging directly with mainstream market institutions and dynamics can enable a social movement to influence consumer behavior much more rapidly than efforts to build &ldquo;alternative&rdquo; supply chains, though such mainstream engagement may also lead to co-option and a lowering of standards; and social movements may need to prioritize strategies to resist pressure from private sector businesses to weaken the standards of certified products.</span></p><h1 class="c26" id="h.oe51488oif5t"><span class="c18">Table of Contents</span></h1><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c8 c29"></span></p><a id="t.1ce6faa880e6ecdbba2470e964db9fcd2029c06e"></a><a id="t.0"></a><table class="c38"><tbody><tr class="c36"><td class="c35" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c5 c31"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c40"><span class="c1 c24"><a class="c14" href="#h.1fob9te">Abstract</a></span></p><p class="c27"><span class="c1"><a class="c14" href="#h.oe51488oif5t">Table of Contents</a></span></p><p class="c27"><span class="c1"><a class="c14" href="#h.q2sgq1688t8r">Introduction</a></span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c1"><a class="c14" href="#h.2et92p0">Summary of Key Implications</a></span></p><p class="c27"><span class="c1"><a class="c14" href="#h.tyjcwt">A Condensed Chronological History of the Fair Trade Movement</a></span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c1"><a class="c14" href="#h.3dy6vkm">Early history of Fair Trade</a></span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c1"><a class="c14" href="#h.1t3h5sf">1964-88: Alternative trade</a></span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c1"><a class="c14" href="#h.4d34og8">1988-97: Product certification and the switch from handicrafts to foodstuffs</a></span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c1"><a class="c14" href="#h.2s8eyo1">1997-present: The mainstreaming of Fair Trade</a></span></p><p class="c27"><span class="c1"><a class="c14" href="#h.17dp8vu">The Extent of the Success of the Fair Trade Movement</a></span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c1"><a class="c14" href="#h.3rdcrjn">Changes to Behavior</a></span></p><p class="c33"><span class="c1"><a class="c14" href="#h.26in1rg">Benefits to the Intended Beneficiaries of the Movement, Assuming Changes to Behavior</a></span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c1"><a class="c14" href="#h.lnxbz9">Legislative and Legal Changes</a></span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c1"><a class="c14" href="#h.35nkun2">Acceptance and Inclusion</a></span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c1"><a class="c14" href="#h.1ksv4uv">Changes to Public Opinion and the Salience of the Issue</a></span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c1"><a class="c14" href="#h.44sinio">Provider Availability</a></span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c1"><a class="c14" href="#h.2jxsxqh">Organizational Resources</a></span></p><p class="c27"><span class="c1"><a class="c14" href="#h.z337ya">Features of the Fair Trade Movement</a></span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c1"><a class="c14" href="#h.3j2qqm3">Intended Beneficiaries of the Movement</a></span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c1"><a class="c14" href="#h.1y810tw">Institution</a></span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c1"><a class="c14" href="#h.4i7ojhp">Advocacy</a></span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c1"><a class="c14" href="#h.2xcytpi">Society</a></span></p><p class="c27"><span class="c1"><a class="c14" href="#h.1ci93xb">Strategic Implications</a></span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c1"><a class="c14" href="#h.3whwml4">Consumer Action and Individual Behavioral Change</a></span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c1"><a class="c14" href="#h.2bn6wsx">Institutional Reform</a></span></p><p class="c27"><span class="c1"><a class="c14" href="#h.qsh70q">Potential Items for Further Study</a></span></p><p class="c41"><span class="c1"><a class="c14" href="#h.3as4poj">Selected Bibliography</a></span></p><p class="c31 c5"><span class="c29 c8"></span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><h1 class="c26" id="h.q2sgq1688t8r"><span class="c18">Introduction</span></h1><p class="c6"><span class="c0">One definition of Fair Trade, jointly agreed by several international Fair Trade organizations, is: </span></p><p class="c6 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6 c34"><span>[A] trading partnership, based on dialogue, transparency and respect, that seeks greater equity in international trade. It contributes to sustainable development by offering better trading conditions to, and securing the rights of, marginalized producers and workers&mdash;especially in the South. Fair trade organisations (backed by consumers) are engaged actively in supporting producers, awareness raising and in campaigning for changes in the rules and practice of conventional international trade.</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt1" id="ftnt_ref1">[1]</a></sup></p><p class="c6 c5 c34"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span>The nonprofits, activists, and mission-driven businesses promoting this kind of trading partnership comprise the &ldquo;Fair Trade movement.&rdquo;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt2" id="ftnt_ref2">[2]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span>The Fair Trade movement&rsquo;s intended beneficiaries are &ldquo;disadvantaged producers&rdquo; in the Global South.</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt3" id="ftnt_ref3">[3]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;Fairtrade International (also known as Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International or FLO), summarizes that, for participating producers, Fair Trade means: </span></p><ul class="c23 lst-kix_list_2-0 start"><li class="c6 c11 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Prices that aim to cover the average costs of producing their crop sustainably &ndash; a vital safety net when market prices drop</span></li><li class="c6 c11 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">The Fairtrade Premium &ndash; an extra sum of money paid on top of the selling price to invest in business or community projects of their choice</span></li><li class="c6 c11 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Decent working conditions and a ban on discrimination, forced labour and child labour</span></li><li class="c6 c11 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Access to advance credit ahead of harvest time</span></li><li class="c6 c11 li-bullet-0"><span>Being able to plan more for the future with more security and stronger relationships with buyers.&rdquo;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt4" id="ftnt_ref4">[4]</a></sup></li></ul><p class="c6 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span>Consumers and institutions in the Global North are the key audience of the Fair Trade movement.

Although there are differences between the Fair Trade movement and other social movements focused on moral circle expansion, such as the farmed animal movement, these other movements can glean some strategic insight about which strategies are most effective from the history of Fair Trade.</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt6" id="ftnt_ref6">[6]</a></sup></p><p class="c6 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span>This case study has a broader geographic focus than Sentience Institute&rsquo;s previous four social movement case studies,</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt7" id="ftnt_ref7">[7]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;primarily because there is often limited evidence or information about Fair Trade in individual countries.

This is similar to the usage by sociologist William Gamson, who defined success for social movement organizations in terms of either &ldquo;acceptance&rdquo; by their antagonists or &ldquo;new advantages&rdquo; accrued for their intended beneficiaries; &ldquo;co-optation&rdquo; (co-option) is where an organization or movement achieves &ldquo;acceptance&rdquo; but not &ldquo;new advantages.&rdquo;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt9" id="ftnt_ref9">[9]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;The terms &ldquo;Global North&rdquo; and &ldquo;Global South&rdquo; are used, following recent scholarly usage.</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt10" id="ftnt_ref10">[10]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;The meaning is similar to the terms &ldquo;developed&rdquo; and &ldquo;developing&rdquo;; the former category contains North America, Europe, Australia, and a handful of other countries (such as Japan, South Korea, and Israel), while the latter term includes most of Asia, Central America, South America, and Africa. &ldquo;Northern&rdquo; and &ldquo;Southern&rdquo; are used as the adjectives for these terms.</span></p><p class="c6 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span>From the 1990s, coffee became an important part of the Fair Trade movement&rsquo;s product mix.</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt11" id="ftnt_ref11">[11]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;Many scholars focus primarily on coffee when evaluating the Fair Trade movement.</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt12" id="ftnt_ref12">[12]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;Given the greater availability of evidence and analysis for this product type, sometimes this report discusses Fair Trade coffee assuming that it is fairly representative of Fair Trade foodstuffs more widely. Note, however, that there may be differences from product to product, and the movement sells a larger volume of Fair Trade bananas than coffee.</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt13" id="ftnt_ref13">[13]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;Many scholars also focus primarily on the movement in the UK,</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt14" id="ftnt_ref14">[14]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;though this seems more clearly justified, given that the UK sells the most Fair Trade products.</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt15" id="ftnt_ref15">[15]</a></sup></p><h2 class="c12" id="h.2et92p0"><span class="c19">Summary of Key Implications</span></h2><p class="c6"><span>A single historical case study does not provide strong evidence for any general claim on social change strategy; the value of these case studies comes from providing insight into a large number of important questions.</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt16" id="ftnt_ref16">[16]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;This section lists a number of strategic claims supported by the evidence in this report:</span></p><ul class="c23 lst-kix_list_1-0 start"><li class="c6 c11 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Engaging directly with mainstream market institutions and dynamics will enable a social movement to influence consumer behavior much more rapidly than efforts to build &ldquo;alternative&rdquo; supply chains.</span></li><li class="c6 c11 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Engaging directly with mainstream market institutions and dynamics may lead to co-option and a lowering of standards.</span></li><li class="c6 c11 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Social movements should implement strategies to resist pressure from private sector businesses to weaken the standards of certified products.</span></li><li class="c6 c11 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Social movements should seek to minimize the number of competing certification schemes.</span></li><li class="c6 c11 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Certification schemes may be ineffective or counterproductive in high-priority countries.</span></li><li class="c6 c11 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Marketing efforts likely increase awareness and purchases of certified products, but high awareness and support do not necessarily lead to widespread changes in consumer behavior.</span></li><li class="c6 c11 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Individuals who participate in consumer action are more likely to participate in other forms of activism.</span></li><li class="c6 c11 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Social movements engaging with market mechanisms may be able to draw substantial funding from for-profit organizations.</span></li></ul><h1 class="c26" id="h.tyjcwt"><span class="c18">A Condensed Chronological History of the Fair Trade Movement</span></h1><h2 class="c12" id="h.3dy6vkm"><span class="c19">Early history of Fair Trade</span></h2><p class="c6"><span>In the 19th and early 20th centuries, there were likely several examples of companies that implemented policies resembling those of the more recent Fair Trade movement, such as The Hamodava Tea Company, set up in 1899 by the Salvation Army, which sought to pay farmers fair prices and enable them to buy the land that they worked on.</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt17" id="ftnt_ref17">[17]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span>There have been previous examples of ethically motivated &ldquo;buycotts,&rdquo; which urge consumers to purchase ethically preferable goods.

Schmeler summarizes that, &ldquo;[t]he limited success of the White Label Campaign, licensing at its peak in 1904 up to 60 factories all over the USA, led to exuberant praise by many academics &ndash; mirroring the comments on fair trade today that put consumers as political agents of change centre-stage. The NCL&rsquo;s white label campaign ended in 1918 in the context of the general decline of the first consumer movement of the Progressive Era, which tapered off by the end of the First World War, and due to changes in consumer taste, mainly fostered through mainstream commercial advertisements, and because of competing labour union labels. Realizing the limitations of raising consciousness and relying on voluntary compliance of consumers and producers, in the late 1920s and 1930s the NCL also changed tactics,&rdquo; focusing increasingly on legislative tactics. &ldquo;After the Second World War, these efforts were transformed into the modern comparative-testing form of consumer expertise that spread from the USA to Europe in the 1950s and 1960s and that were more concerned with the security and quality of products from the perspective of consumers &ndash; the issue of responsibility for producers, so central to the rise of the Consumers&rsquo; Leagues, was taken up by other groups.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8">Matthew Anderson, </span><span class="c7">A History of Fair Trade in Contemporary Britain: From Civil Society Campaigns to Corporate Compliance</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;(Basingstoke, UK: Palgrave Macmillan, 2015), 7-11 discusses several more tenuous historical parallels of the Fair Trade movement in the United Kingdom, including the &ldquo;Buy Empire Goods campaign&rdquo; of the early 20th century and the &ldquo;moral economy in the English crowd in the eighteenth century,&rdquo; which &ldquo;asserted the right of the poor consumers to gain access to the means of life.&rdquo; Anderson comments that, &ldquo;[t]aken together the concepts of &lsquo;market failure&rsquo; and &lsquo;consumer duty&rsquo; have been fundamental to Fair Trade campaigns.&rdquo; Similarly, Frank Trentmann, &ldquo;Before &lsquo;Fair Trade&rsquo;: Empire, Free Trade, and the Moral Economies of Food in the Modern World,&rdquo; </span><span class="c7">Environment and Planning D: Society and Space </span><span class="c4">25, no. 6 (2007), 1082 highlights the &ldquo;buying for empire campaigns and the movements for a &lsquo;just&rsquo; world food plan&rdquo; in the 1920-40s.

Their dissatisfaction with the GATT led to the creation of UNCTAD (the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development) in 1964. This was set up as an organisation which would be responsible for creating &lsquo;an international trading environment that would facilitate the growth of developing countries and not thwart it&rsquo;. A year later an additional chapter was added to the GATT which gave developing countries what is known as special and differential treatment (S&amp;D).

While the natural market for fair trade products at the moment seems logically to be young urban professionals and activist groups in higher education, it is hard to tell if this is due to preference by these groups or simply lack of knowledge and availability.

The change was considered necessary because &lsquo;stores have been perceived as do-it-yourself crafts supply stores&rsquo;. Second, one of the peak bodies of the fair trade movement, IFAT, which was only officially constituted in 1989, changed its name from the International Federation for Alternative Trade to IFAT &ndash; the International Fair Trade Association in 2003. Finally, in August 2004, SERRV International launched a new name, A Greater Gift, for its handcraft program.

The verification of stocks was also discontinued, as were the provisions relating to production policies; in addition a decision was taken to wind up the activities of the Promotion Fund. Members accepted the recommendation of the Council and the 1983 Agreement was duly extended&hellip; The process of negotiating a new Agreement gained new impetus with the fall of prices to record lows during coffee years 1990/91 and 1991/92, and the Council agreed to a further extension of the Agreement until 30 September 1993&hellip; This time, Members concentrated on negotiating an Agreement which did not set out to regulate coffee prices. This process concluded successfully with the negotiation of the International Coffee Agreement 1994, which entered into force on 1 October 1994.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8">&ldquo;Mission,&rdquo; International Coffee Organization, accessed July 16, 2020, </span><span class="c1"><a class="c14" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200716075035/http://www.ico.org/mission07_e.asp?section%3DAbout_Us">https://web.archive.org/web/20200716075035/http://www.ico.org/mission07_e.asp?section=About_Us</a></span><span class="c4">&nbsp;explains that, &ldquo;[t]he International Coffee Organization (ICO) is the main intergovernmental organization for coffee, bringing together exporting and importing Governments to tackle the challenges facing the world coffee sector through international cooperation&hellip; The ICO was set up in London in 1963 under the auspices of the United Nations.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8 c17 c9">April Linton, Cindy Chiayuan Liou, and Kelly Ann Shaw, &ldquo;A Taste of Trade Justice: Marketing Global Social Responsibility Via Fair Trade Coffee,&rdquo; </span><span class="c7 c17 c9">Globalizations</span><span class="c8 c17 c9">&nbsp;1, no. 2 (2004), 227 summarize that, </span><span class="c4">&ldquo;[b]y the end of the 1980s support for the ICA had eroded to the point that the agreement could not be renewed.

In January 1993 a new internal committee was formed, known as the Consumer Issues Group. This was an important moment because it brought together senior management representatives from across the business to work on a strategy that would see the Co-op established as the UK&rsquo;s most ethical retailer. In 1997 the strategic review, that had followed the failed takeover, saw the Co-op focus on its core strength of convenience stores; and responsible retailing was given a greater role in positioning the &lsquo;Co-operative difference&rsquo;. The organisational restructuring also led to the departure of two senior managers and as a result key positions within the revised structure were filled by members of the Consumer Issues Group. By the end of 1997, the respective heads of food retail, marketing, Co-op brand, public relations and corporate affairs were all original members of the Consumer Issues Group and active supporters of the responsible retailing agenda. The tipping point, in terms of Co-op support for Fairtrade, came just 2 years later in 1999 with the introduction of Fairtrade products into all 1,450 grocery stores. Following the successful national roll-out of Fairtrade, the Co-op became the largest stockist of Fairtrade labelled products in Britain.&rdquo; By comparison, on pages 126-9, Anderson presents Nestl&eacute;&rsquo;s interest in Fair Trade a decade later as driven by market demand rather than mission alignment and internal advocacy.</span></p></div><div><p class="c2"><a href="#ftnt_ref82" id="ftnt82">[82]</a><span class="c8">&nbsp;William Low and Eileen Davenport, &ldquo;Mainstreaming Fair Trade: Adoption, Assimilation, Appropriation,&rdquo; </span><span class="c7">Journal of Strategic Marketing</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;14, no. 4 (2006), 320.</span></p></div><div><p class="c2"><a href="#ftnt_ref83" id="ftnt83">[83]</a><span class="c8">&nbsp;&ldquo;Our Grassroots History&rdquo; in &ldquo;Who We Are,&rdquo; &nbsp;World Fair Trade Organization, accessed February 24, 2020, </span><span class="c1"><a class="c14" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200224093228/https://wfto.com/who-we-are">https://web.archive.org/web/20200224093228/https://wfto.com/who-we-are</a></span><span class="c8">&nbsp;and William Low and Eileen Davenport, &ldquo;Postcards from the Edge: Maintaining the &lsquo;Alternative&rsquo; Character of Fair Trade,&rdquo; </span><span class="c7">Sustainable Development</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;13, no. 3 (2005), 147.</span></p></div><div><p class="c2"><a href="#ftnt_ref84" id="ftnt84">[84]</a><span class="c8">&nbsp;Geoff Moore, Jane Gibbon, and Richard Slack, &ldquo;The Mainstreaming of Fair Trade: A Macromarketing Perspective,&rdquo; </span><span class="c7">Journal of Strategic Marketing</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;14, no. 4 (2006), 330.</span></p></div><div><p class="c2"><a href="#ftnt_ref85" id="ftnt85">[85]</a><span class="c8">&nbsp;&ldquo;Our Grassroots History&rdquo; in &ldquo;Who We Are,&rdquo; &nbsp;World Fair Trade Organization, accessed February 24, 2020, </span><span class="c1"><a class="c14" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200224093228/https://wfto.com/who-we-are">https://web.archive.org/web/20200224093228/https://wfto.com/who-we-are</a></span><span class="c4">.</span></p></div><div><p class="c2"><a href="#ftnt_ref86" id="ftnt86">[86]</a><span class="c8">&nbsp;&ldquo;Our Grassroots History&rdquo; in &ldquo;Who We Are,&rdquo; &nbsp;World Fair Trade Organization, accessed February 24, 2020, </span><span class="c1"><a class="c14" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200224093228/https://wfto.com/who-we-are">https://web.archive.org/web/20200224093228/https://wfto.com/who-we-are</a></span><span class="c4">.</span></p></div><div><p class="c2"><a href="#ftnt_ref87" id="ftnt87">[87]</a><span class="c8">&nbsp;Laura T.

By 2003 there were as many plantation workers as small farmers producing Fairtrade certified bananas and other fruits.

The review was undertaken with pro bono services from McKinseys and had a wide-ranging remit. The review built upon an impact assessment that had been conducted during 2000 and came to some tough conclusions. The problem was perhaps best illustrated by the economic analysis of one of the supply chains. The analysis identified that for a product that could sell for $30; Oxfam had to spend $45 in getting it to market. Oxfam would have been less worried about this if the other $15 was going to the producer. However, Oxfam calculated that the producer was only getting $5 of additional benefits; the rest was the cost of supporting their trading model. Oxfam employed business consultants in the field, ran the logistics including an expensive warehouse operation in Oxford and owned all the shops that products sold through. McKinseys recommended that Oxfam should focus on working with producers through its Sustainable Livelihoods team and create an enabling environment for Fair Trade within the UK consumers and the shops they bought from. Everything else was not core to Fair Trade and Oxfam is currently restructuring to close its &ldquo;alternative trading&rdquo; operation. While the decision by Oxfam to shut down the majority of its Fair Trade Co activity was perhaps the most radical in the movement, it was a wake up call to many others.&rdquo;</span></p></div><div><p class="c2"><a href="#ftnt_ref125" id="ftnt125">[125]</a><span class="c8">&nbsp;Matthew Anderson, </span><span class="c7">A History of Fair Trade in Contemporary Britain: From Civil Society Campaigns to Corporate Compliance</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;(Basingstoke, UK: Palgrave Macmillan, 2015), 40-1.</span></p></div><div><p class="c2"><a href="#ftnt_ref126" id="ftnt126">[126]</a><span class="c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c9">William Low and Eileen Davenport, &ldquo;To Boldly Go&hellip; Exploring Ethical Spaces to Re&#8208;Politicise Ethical Consumption and Fair Trade,&rdquo; </span><span class="c7 c9">Journal of Consumer Behaviour: An International Research Review</span><span class="c8 c9">&nbsp;6, no. 5 (2007), 345.

FT USA&rsquo;s decision reveals longstanding differences between the market-oriented US certification agency on the one hand and its more movement-oriented European counterparts and FLO on the other. These groups had managed to work together and FT USA had been granted a seat on FLO&rsquo;s board for most of the organization&#39;s history. But this strategic divide has been noted in my interviews with Fair Trade representatives on both sides of the Atlantic for at least a decade. In case anyone failed to see the divergence, they need only have looked at FT USA&rsquo;s noncompliance with FLO policies that labeling agencies be membership organizations and use the common international certification label&hellip; In addition to consolidating its control, FT USA wants to expand supply by certifying farmers who are not members of cooperatives, plantations in sectors like coffee which is restricted by FLO to small producers, and US producers. The labeling agency believes that by growing the market and increasing mainstream corporate participation, more producers will benefit from Fair Trade prices and premiums.&rdquo; Quotes from both FT USA and FLO are provided.</span></p></div><div><p class="c2"><a href="#ftnt_ref149" id="ftnt149">[149]</a><span class="c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c9">Sarah Lyon, &ldquo;Fair Trade Towns USA: Growing the Market Within a Diverse Economy,&rdquo; </span><span class="c7 c9">Journal of Political Ecology </span><span class="c8 c9">21, no. 1 (2014), 149.</span></p></div><div><p class="c2"><a href="#ftnt_ref150" id="ftnt150">[150]</a><span class="c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c9">Sarah Lyon, &ldquo;Fair Trade Towns USA: Growing the Market Within a Diverse Economy,&rdquo; </span><span class="c7 c9">Journal of Political Ecology </span><span class="c8 c9">21, no. 1 (2014), 152.

Where a public has not been the target of campaigns, Fair Trade coffee was not available, and, we learned [through their interviews with retailers], no one asked for it. This suggests that Fair Traders working to [expand] the U.S. market should continue to focus on getting consumers&rsquo; attention and educating them about the issues as well as on getting roasters, retailers, and restaurants that buy Fair Trade coffee to advertise their purchase.

Instead, in 2004 Starbucks launched its own self-monitored first-party label &lsquo;C.A.F.E&rsquo; (Coffee and Farmers Equity) practices, which currently certifies 65 per cent of Starbucks&rsquo; total coffee sales &ndash; a percentage that is projected to rise to 80 per cent by 2013. This label was &lsquo;designed to help ensure that high-quality coffee is grown and processed in a socially and environmentally responsible manner&rsquo;. Starbucks even started to outsource the monitoring of its own label, which is now conducted by Scientific Certification Systems (SCS) and currently employs 38 third-party certifiers. In assessing these developments one first has to take into account the high price Starbucks pays to its producers &ndash; currently more than the fair trade minimum price. It is however also important to take a close look at the supply chain, to dig into the reasons why Starbucks does not increase its fair trade sales and to analyze in how far these high prices are outweighed by the high costs of standard compliance and the high quality requirements. The C.A.F.E label is only a &lsquo;code of conduct-lite&rsquo;, focusing first and foremost on the intrinsic quality and the taste of the coffee and adding ecological and social standards as secondary. The high price Starbucks pays for its coffee can partly be explained by the fact that Starbucks only buys gourmet coffee with extremely high intrinsic qualities. Some of the important differences to the fair trade label are that the payment of higher premium prices increases with better performance instead of a guaranteeing a minimum price; the infrastructure of certification remains internal to Starbucks, making it impossible for producers to influence the standards; verifiers are not entirely autonomous, making it a &lsquo;fully private&rsquo; space as opposed to the &lsquo;semi-public&rsquo; space of fair trade certification, and rendering the self-proclamation of C.A.F.E. as &lsquo;third party&rsquo; certification questionable; and there is less organizational and developmental support than in fair trade. A variety of reports show severe problems of Starbucks own label at the producer level that forced several cooperatives to break up their trading relations with Starbucks.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c4 c9"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8 c9">&ldquo;Goals &amp; Progress: Coffee Purchasing,&rdquo; Starbucks, accessed November 4, 2020, </span><span class="c1 c9"><a class="c14" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201125144354/https://www.starbucks.com/responsibility/global-report/ethical-sourcing/coffee-purchasing">https://web.archive.org/web/20201125144354/https://www.starbucks.com/responsibility/global-report/ethical-sourcing/coffee-purchasing</a></span><span class="c8 c9">&nbsp;notes that, &ldquo;[i]n 2011 34.3 million pounds (8.0 percent) of our coffee purchases were Fairtrade certified&rdquo; and that, &ldquo;86% of our coffee was ethically sourced under C.A.F.E.

Through access to Fair Trade markets, these farmers have been able to sell their coffee at prices more than double the street price paid by local coyotes (intermediaries), the traditional means of access to the coffee market for most small producers.&rdquo; They explain that their research is based on &ldquo;seven case studies of small-scale producer cooperatives participating in Fair Trade&rdquo; in Latin America. On page 182, they add that, &ldquo;[f]armers are understandably drawn to Fair Trade for the premium paid for certified coffee. The case of Majomut is indicative, with farmers producing on average 1500 lbs of Fair Trade coffee, for which they receive US$1700, compared to the street price paid by local coyotes of US$550. With coffee representing 80 per cent of Majomut members&rsquo; family incomes, the economic benefit of participating in Fair Trade is clear. Yet our research also found a range of other benefits at times less obvious, but in some ways more significant. (2) Fair Trade has provided increased economic and social stability to participants, and greater access to technical training. This in turn has led to improvements in the quality of small-producer coffee and higher productivity. Farmers&rsquo; families have also benefited, for instance through greater access to education for their children. Many indigenous farmers also saw Fair Trade as an important vehicle for cultural revival, most notably in the cases of the Tzotzilotic and La Selva cooperatives in the southern Mexico state of Chiapas, and the La Voz cooperative in the Guatemalan highlands. Fair Trade has also contributed to strengthening farmers&rsquo; organisations, which in turn has fostered access to other opportunities for cooperatives and their members. These opportunities include direct marketing of their coffee and other commodities, and access to training in organic farming techniques and other methods to improve the quality of their coffee.&rdquo;</span></p></div><div><p class="c2"><a href="#ftnt_ref189" id="ftnt189">[189]</a><span class="c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c9">Raluca Dragusanu, Daniele Giovannucci, and Nathan Nunn, &ldquo;The Economics of Fair Trade,&rdquo; </span><span class="c7 c9">Journal of Economic Perspectives </span><span class="c8 c9">28, no. 3 (2014), 224-6.</span></p></div><div><p class="c2"><a href="#ftnt_ref190" id="ftnt190">[190]</a><span class="c8">&nbsp;Robbert Maseland and Albert De Vaal, &ldquo;How Fair is Fair Trade?&rdquo; </span><span class="c7">De Economist</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;150, no. 3 (2002), 269.</span></p></div><div><p class="c2"><a href="#ftnt_ref191" id="ftnt191">[191]</a><span class="c8">&nbsp;&ldquo;Choosing a Fairer Future Through Trade: Annual Report 2018-2019,&rdquo; Fairtrade International, accessed December 17, 2020, </span><span class="c1"><a class="c14" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201217082543/https://files.fairtrade.net/publications/2018-19_FI_AnnualReport.pdf">https://web.archive.org/web/20201217082543/https://files.fairtrade.net/publications/2018-19_FI_AnnualReport.pdf</a></span><span class="c4">&nbsp;reports that, &ldquo;Fairtrade global retail sales reached an estimated &euro;9.8 billion in 2018.&rdquo; They also note that, &ldquo;[f]armers and workers earned &euro;176.5 million in Fairtrade Premium in 2018 for the top 7 products&rdquo; and that these &ldquo;seven products account for more than 90 percent of Fairtrade certified producers: bananas, cocoa, coffee, cotton, flowers and plants, sugar and tea.&rdquo; So we can roughly estimate that the total premium earned is around &euro;195 million.</span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8">Katharina Bissinger, &ldquo;Price Fairness: Two-Stage Comparison of Conventional and Fairtrade Prices,&rdquo; Journal of International Consumer Marketing 31, no. 2 (2019), 86-97 found that, &ldquo;fairtrade producer prices are twice as high as the conventionally traded equivalent.&rdquo; Arnab K.

Women&rsquo;s domestic responsibilities were not adjusted to compensate for their increased workloads. More positively, in producer groups like SHARE in Southern India, the combination of increased business and support from local NGOs have had a synergistic effect. SHARE, run by women for women, organizes palm leaf basket makers into village credit and savings groups.

Fieldwork conducted with banana workers and growers in Urab&aacute; suggests that Fairtrade programs resonate with the local industry&#39;s longer term strategy to promote voluntarism as the appropriate mechanism for alleviating poverty and inequality. In addition, by creating disparities in the material resources and structures of negotiation available to banana workers, Fairtrade has produced new uneven geographies within the regional banana production complex.

It is difficult to deny that this is a theoretical problem. Problems of this sort created by Fair Trade, however, are unlikely to be substantial as long as Fair Trade remains a relatively small player in the market as a whole.

The research findings show unambiguously that Fairtrade has made no positive difference &ndash; relative to other forms of employment in the production of the same crops &ndash; to wage workers. Systematically, wage workers in the FTEPR sample in research sites characterised by the presence of Fairtrade certified producer organizations earned less than equivalent workers in research sites without Fairtrade production.

For example, the company had dismissed the possibility of advertising in certain men&#39;s magazines (such as FHM and Loaded), based on the premise that the sexually orientated and, in some people&#39;s view, sexually exploitative content of the magazines could offend some of the core protagonists of fair trade. The issue of whether it was OK to potentially &lsquo;offend&rsquo; those in the movement by associating with certain products and brands was raised in the same way in each case, but with different consequences. Clearly the intensity of &lsquo;sexual exploitation of women&rsquo; was rated much higher than the intensity of &lsquo;irreverence.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8">See also </span><span class="c8 c9">Alex Nicholls and Charlotte Opal, </span><span class="c7 c9">Fair Trade: Market-Driven Ethical Consumption</span><span class="c8 c9">&nbsp;(London, UK: Sage, 2005)</span><span class="c8">, 159-61.

In Europe, these included large roasters such as Neuteboom and La Semeuse. In the United States, roasters such as Green Mountain Coffee, specialty stores emphasizing &lsquo;natural&rsquo; and environmentally friendly products, and independent coffee shops were among the first to start purchasing Fair Trade certified coffee. Many of these companies have made considerable efforts getting both their name and the Fair Trade label out into the mainstream market. Very soon, other roasters and grocery store chains signed on to the Fair Trade concept. In 2000, TransFair USA entered into contract with Starbucks, the world&rsquo;s largest coffee chain.

Perhaps the most notable buycotting campaign has been the one headed by Global Exchange, a San Francisco-based human rights NGO, which compelled Starbucks Coffee, the world&#39;s largest specialty coffee roaster, to agree to sell fair trade coffee in its 2,300 stores across the United States in April 2000.

Research by Clive Barnett and colleagues found that 70&ndash;80% of campaigners actively promoting Fairtrade in Bristol were Christians.

As explained by Becchetti and Costantino, the Italian market for fair trade started at a very similar time to the UK, following similar roots in religious and alternative trading world shops. Dominant FTOs such as CTM Altromercato in Italy and Traidcraft in the UK emerged early in both countries. However, following the development of commodity labelling in the 1990s the Italian model continued along this alternative, solidarity based model using predominantly value chain 1 business models [this refers to a typology of different business models within the Fair Trade movement, developed in the article]. The UK, on the other hand, voraciously expanded into the other types of value chain in a comparatively aggressive manner. The impact of these decisions on the growth of fair trade sales is clear. Despite continuing growth in Italy, fair trade still only represents &euro;49m on labelled and &euro;50m non-labelled fair trade produce versus over &euro;1343m in labelled and a further &euro;110m in unlabelled sales in the UK. This shows the UK fair trade market having grown 15 times faster than Italy.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">They add on pages 169-72 that, &ldquo;[i]f you take France (similar GDP and population) as a half-way house between the two countries: fair trade emerged exactly as in the other countries but mainstreaming through type 2 and 3 value chains commenced approximately 10 years later than in the UK, but 10 years earlier than in Italy. France has fair trade sales of &euro;303m on labelled and &euro;56m on non-labelled products, therefore nearly quadruple that of Italy and a quarter that of the UK. Clearly the faster the rate of adoption of mainstream value chains the more rapid the movement&rsquo;s expansion.&rdquo;</span></p></div><div><p class="c2"><a href="#ftnt_ref298" id="ftnt298">[298]</a><span class="c8">&nbsp;Kathryn Wheeler, </span><span class="c7">Fair Trade and the Citizen-Consumer: Shopping for Justice? </span><span class="c4">(Basingstoke, UK: Palgrave Macmillan, 2012), 65 notes that, &ldquo;even though they were unaware that their town was a Fairtrade Town, many of the Chelmsford residents whom I spoke with were actually buying fair-trade products. For example, I found that despite Henry&rsquo;s lack of interest in fair-trade, he had been regularly buying Fairtrade bananas because he shopped at Sainsbury&rsquo;s. Similarly, Daisy, Fran and Kelley described how they liked to visit the Marks &amp; Spencer&rsquo;s cafe for coffee (which is 100 per cent Fairtrade) when they went out shopping together, and yet they swore that they never bought fair-trade. As provisioning policies switch to fair trade, accidental purchases are likely to become increasingly common.&rdquo;</span></p></div><div><p class="c2"><a href="#ftnt_ref299" id="ftnt299">[299]</a><span class="c8">&nbsp;Kathryn Wheeler, </span><span class="c7">Fair Trade and the Citizen-Consumer: Shopping for Justice? </span><span class="c8">(Basingstoke, UK: Palgrave Macmillan, 2012), 67-8 notes that, &ldquo;the ICA Malmsborgs store [a leading grocery retailer in Sweden] in the centre of Lund offers over 200 fair-trade products, and when the controversial film </span><span class="c7">Bananas!* </span><span class="c4">was released they ran the trailer of this film in the store next to the fair-trade bananas to encourage consumers to choose them. This apparently led to a 500 per cent increase in sales of fair-trade bananas during the period the trailer was shown.&rdquo; On page 78, Wheeler adds that, &ldquo;[s]upermarkets are generally supportive of the fair-trade promotional period and use various material devices, such as point of sale displays, cleverly designed packaging and promotional discounts, to guide us towards the &lsquo;right&rsquo; choice&hellip; Retail outlets use the fair-trade promotional period to their advantage to highlight their ethical credentials and to engage with their local community and customers. For example, Whole Foods in the USA ran a series of events during Fair Trade Month 2011, which highlighted their position as a committed retailer of Fair Trade goods.&rdquo;</span></p></div><div><p class="c2"><a href="#ftnt_ref300" id="ftnt300">[300]</a><span class="c8">&nbsp;Daniel Jaffee and Philip H.

There are 500 FLO certified small farmer cooperatives: Latin America has 330 coops with 200,000 members; Africa has 96 coops which are far bigger with over 500,000 members.&rdquo; However, &ldquo;rules that buyers provide credit &lsquo;upon request&rsquo; and pursue &lsquo;long-term&rsquo; contracts are malleable and hard to police. For example, while mission-driven coffee buyers (e.g. Equal Exchange and Caf&eacute;direct) provide significant financing, contract for as much coffee as possible, and purchase from the same cooperatives for years, mainstream buyers (e.g. Procter &amp; Gamble and Nestl&eacute;) typically leave coops to negotiate financing, contract for minimum volumes (and at times require that coops match their Fair Trade sales with sales at conventional prices), and drop suppliers once annual contracts are up.

The guidelines listed seek to eliminate the most abusive labor practices. Guidelines include: provision of bathrooms; limiting child labor; the right to form unions; eliminating discrimination; permitting religious freedom; preventing behavior that is sexually abusive, coercive, or threatening in nature; and abiding by national labor laws. While there is obvious merit in ending odious practices like sexual harassment and discrimination, the extremely limited ambition of the SAI in terms of improving the living standards of workers is worth noting. This is not a document that addresses the fundamental power imbalances in labor or commodities markets, nor does it make a commitment to anything like a &lsquo;living wage&rsquo;... It is also possible that even these limited ambitions might be difficult to realize given the lack of detail on how these guidelines will be monitored and enforced. The SAI working group is still in its early stages, having just completed a review of eleven pilot projects in 2006. However, there are some real problems not only with the low labor standards, but also with the method of monitoring and enforcement. The SAI states only that a neutral entity that hosts the practices and verification systems &lsquo;could be explored.&rsquo; However, as it currently stands, there is little in the SAI to ensure that even the signatories follow their own guidelines. This difficulty is exacerbated since many of the standards would not only apply to the signatories but to their farm suppliers, who would be even more difficult to monitor and enforce.&rdquo;</span></p></div><div><p class="c2"><a href="#ftnt_ref304" id="ftnt304">[304]</a><span class="c4">&nbsp;&ldquo;What Does &lsquo;Rainforest Alliance Certified&rsquo; Mean?&rdquo; Rainforest Alliance (October 28, 2020), https://web.archive.org/web/20210211105651/https://www.rainforest-alliance.org/faqs/what-does-rainforest-alliance-certified-mean.</span></p></div><div><p class="c2"><a href="#ftnt_ref305" id="ftnt305">[305]</a><span class="c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c9">Alex Nicholls and Charlotte Opal, </span><span class="c7 c9">Fair Trade: Market-Driven Ethical Consumption</span><span class="c8 c9">&nbsp;(London, UK: Sage, 2005), 141.</span></p></div><div><p class="c2"><a href="#ftnt_ref306" id="ftnt306">[306]</a><span class="c8">&nbsp;Mark Hudson, Ian Hudson, and Mara Fridell,</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;Fair Trade, Sustainability and Social Change</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;(Basingstoke, UK: Palgrave Macmillan, 2013)</span><span class="c8 c17 c9">, 143.

The thirteen nations with only one Fair Trade certified producer had an average GDP per capita of just $2,807 in 2007. Coffee-producing countries with no Fair Trade producers have an even lower average GDP per head. These data are not particularly helpful, however, as they do not indicate the share of Fair Trade in total production in different countries. Of more interest is the relationship between the share of Fair Trade coffee exports of total coffee exports (a measure of Fair Trade penetration) and national income per head and/or poverty. Using data from 2005&ndash;07 for Fair Trade exports to the USA, it is not possible to find any significant negative relationship between national income per head or poverty and Fair Trade penetration. Indeed, the relationships that were found (though statistically insignificant) suggest that Fair Trade penetration is greater where income per head is greater; that penetration is greater the more equal is the distribution of incomes; and that penetration is greater the stronger the rule of law.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8">William MacAskill, </span><span class="c7">Doing Good Better: Effective Altruism and a Radical New Way to Make a Difference </span><span class="c8">(London, UK: Guardian Books, 2015), 164-5 notes that, &ldquo;the majority of production comes from comparatively rich countries like Mexico and Costa Rica, which are ten times richer than the very poorest countries like Ethiopia.

Howley (2006), Booth and Whetstone (2007) and Henderson (2008) are critical of the administration and promotional costs of Fair Trade. They feel that Fair Trade has grown into a complex bureaucracy and an industry in itself. Consequently, it has to charge high certification fees to cover these costs, which eats up a major proportion of the Fair Trade price premium. The Fair Trade viewpoint is that it needs to have in place proper systems of checking and conducting inspections all through the supply chain &ndash; something which is expensive. The high expenditure on promotional activities is necessary as Fair Trade&rsquo;s success depends upon reaching consumers and building their capacity to pay a premium for its products: Fair Trade can exist as long as some consumers&rsquo; willingness to pay is sufficient to cover the costs of the Fair Trade process.&rdquo;</span></p></div><div><p class="c2"><a href="#ftnt_ref338" id="ftnt338">[338]</a><span class="c8">&nbsp;Sushil Mohan, </span><span class="c7">Fair Trade Without the Froth</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;(London, UK: Institute of Economic Affairs Monographs, 2010), 54-5.

Also, retailers are not likely to misuse Fair Trade as they are now increasingly concerned about image improvement and wish to be seen doing something to help poor producers.

On page 476, they note that they &ldquo;use the estimated coffee-specific indirect utility functions to calculate the price premia consumers are willing to pay over and above $1 for a Fair Trade coffee, Columbian grown coffee, relative to a $1 non-labelled Columbian coffee that is not organic. In Fig. 2, we hold participation increases at 10% and examine how the price premium varies for different levels of grower revenue increases. The peak premium occurs at approximately 75% (for US respondents) and 55% (for German respondents), beyond which it declines. The results show that for some regions of label performance, our respondents&rsquo; willingness to pay is increasing as the programme increases revenues accruing to participants (poverty aversion). However, as performance continues to increase, the willingness to pay peaks and declines for further revenue increases to programme participants, providing evidence that respondents are sensitive to the notion that non-participants in the Fair Trade programme are becoming relatively worse off (inequality aversion). German respondents appear to be more sensitive, and therefore their willingness to pay declines more as relative inequality increases. Sensitivity of German respondents to the inequality deepening aspect of the Fair Trade coffee label alludes to a preference bias towards a more egalitarian distribution of income.&rdquo;</span></p></div><div><p class="c2"><a href="#ftnt_ref341" id="ftnt341">[341]</a><span class="c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c9">Raluca Dragusanu, Daniele Giovannucci, and Nathan Nunn, &ldquo;The Economics of Fair Trade,&rdquo; </span><span class="c7 c9">Journal of Economic Perspectives</span><span class="c8 c9">&nbsp;28, no. 3 (2014), 222-3 summarize that, </span><span class="c4">&ldquo;Hertel, Scruggs, and Heidkamp (2009) survey 258 individuals and find that 75 percent of coffee buyers report that they would be willing to pay 50 cents extra for a pound of coffee (approximately 15 percent of the sales price) if it was Fair Trade certified. Over half would be willing to pay $1 more per pound. Complementing the evidence from survey questions asking about hypothetical scenarios is evidence from field experiments that observe real-life behavior. Hainmueller, Hiscox, and Sequeira (2011) conduct a number of experiments in 26 stores belonging to a major US grocery chain. The authors randomly placed Fair Trade labels on bulk bins of coffee that were Fair Trade certified. In a second experiment, the authors also randomly varied the prices of the coffee. Each treatment lasted four weeks. The authors found that sales were 10 percent greater when the coffee was labeled as Fair Trade. They also found that demand for more expensive (and arguably higher quality) Fair Trade coffee was insensitive to price, which is consistent with an earlier finding by Arnot, Boxall, and Cash (2006) for brewed coffee sold at a Canadian university. Interestingly, demand for a cheaper and lower-quality Fair Trade coffee was sensitive to the price: a 9 percent increase in price resulted in a 30 percent decline in demand. In a follow-up experiment using coffee sold on eBay, Hiscox, Broukhim, and Litwin (2011) find that on average, consumers are willing to pay a 23 percent premium for coffee labeled as Fair Trade. In a series of auxiliary experiments looking at Fair Trade labeling for nonfood consumer items, Michael Hiscox and various coauthors have accumulated a large amount of additional evidence that confirms the findings from Hainmueller, Hiscox, and Sequeira (2011). Examining fair labor standards for candles and towels sold in a large retail store in New York City, Hiscox and Smyth (2011) find that the label increased sales by 10 percent, and when combined by a price markup of 10&ndash;20 percent, sales rose even more, in the range of 16&ndash;33 percent. Examining consumers&rsquo; willingness to pay for goods using an auction environment on eBay, Hiscox, Broukhim, Litwin, and Wolowski (2011) find that consumers paid a 45 percent premium for polo shirts labeled as being certified for fair labor standards.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8 c9">April Linton, Cindy Chiayuan Liou, and Kelly Ann Shaw, &ldquo;A Taste of Trade Justice: Marketing Global Social Responsibility Via Fair Trade Coffee,&rdquo; </span><span class="c7 c9">Globalizations</span><span class="c8 c9">&nbsp;1, no. 2 (2004), 238-9 note that, given that Fair Trade coffee products come with a price premium, they have tended to compete with the &ldquo;speciality&rdquo; coffee market, where businesses compete on product quality.

Therefore, strategies for changing patterns of consumption must act on the collective level and seek to transform social practices rather than focusing on the individual level of consumer choice. Recent moves towards collective Fairtrade provisioning policies in retail outlets and public spaces (many of which are led by the Fairtrade Towns movement) can be seen as a step in the right direction towards this objective.&rdquo;</span></p></div><div><p class="c2"><a href="#ftnt_ref350" id="ftnt350">[350]</a><span class="c8">&nbsp;Carola Grebitus, Monika Hartmann, and Nina Langen, &ldquo;The Ethical Consumer&rsquo;s Willingness to Pay for Coffee: A comparison of Donations, Fair Trade, Organic, and Cause-Related Marketing Coffees,&rdquo; in </span><span class="c7">II Workshop on: Valuation Methods in Agro-Food and Environmental Economics &ldquo;Experimental Auctions: Theoretical Background and Empirical Applications</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;(2009) compared willingness to pay (WTP) for five types of coffee (conventional, organic, Fair Trade, organic and Fair Trade, or &ldquo;cause-related marketing coffee&rdquo;) in experimental auctions and choice experiments with 38 German students.
