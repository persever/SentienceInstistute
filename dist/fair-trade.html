The analysis highlights strategic implications for a variety of movements, especially those focused on moral circle expansion. Key findings of this report include that engaging directly with mainstream market institutions and dynamics can enable a social movement to influence consumer behavior much more rapidly than efforts to build &ldquo;alternative&rdquo; supply chains, though such mainstream engagement may also lead to co-option and a lowering of standards; and social movements may need to prioritize strategies to resist pressure from private sector businesses to weaken the standards of certified products.</span></p><h1 class="c26" id="h.oe51488oif5t"><span class="c18">Table of Contents</span></h1><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c8 c29"></span></p><a id="t.1ce6faa880e6ecdbba2470e964db9fcd2029c06e"></a><a id="t.0"></a><table class="c38"><tbody><tr class="c36"><td class="c35" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c5 c31"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c40"><span class="c1 c24"><a class="c14" href="#h.1fob9te">Abstract</a></span></p><p class="c27"><span class="c1"><a class="c14" href="#h.oe51488oif5t">Table of Contents</a></span></p><p class="c27"><span class="c1"><a class="c14" href="#h.q2sgq1688t8r">Introduction</a></span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c1"><a class="c14" href="#h.2et92p0">Summary of Key Implications</a></span></p><p class="c27"><span class="c1"><a class="c14" href="#h.tyjcwt">A Condensed Chronological History of the Fair Trade Movement</a></span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c1"><a class="c14" href="#h.3dy6vkm">Early history of Fair Trade</a></span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c1"><a class="c14" href="#h.1t3h5sf">1964-88: Alternative trade</a></span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c1"><a class="c14" href="#h.4d34og8">1988-97: Product certification and the switch from handicrafts to foodstuffs</a></span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c1"><a class="c14" href="#h.2s8eyo1">1997-present: The mainstreaming of Fair Trade</a></span></p><p class="c27"><span class="c1"><a class="c14" href="#h.17dp8vu">The Extent of the Success of the Fair Trade Movement</a></span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c1"><a class="c14" href="#h.3rdcrjn">Changes to Behavior</a></span></p><p class="c33"><span class="c1"><a class="c14" href="#h.26in1rg">Benefits to the Intended Beneficiaries of the Movement, Assuming Changes to Behavior</a></span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c1"><a class="c14" href="#h.lnxbz9">Legislative and Legal Changes</a></span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c1"><a class="c14" href="#h.35nkun2">Acceptance and Inclusion</a></span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c1"><a class="c14" href="#h.1ksv4uv">Changes to Public Opinion and the Salience of the Issue</a></span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c1"><a class="c14" href="#h.44sinio">Provider Availability</a></span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c1"><a class="c14" href="#h.2jxsxqh">Organizational Resources</a></span></p><p class="c27"><span class="c1"><a class="c14" href="#h.z337ya">Features of the Fair Trade Movement</a></span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c1"><a class="c14" href="#h.3j2qqm3">Intended Beneficiaries of the Movement</a></span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c1"><a class="c14" href="#h.1y810tw">Institution</a></span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c1"><a class="c14" href="#h.4i7ojhp">Advocacy</a></span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c1"><a class="c14" href="#h.2xcytpi">Society</a></span></p><p class="c27"><span class="c1"><a class="c14" href="#h.1ci93xb">Strategic Implications</a></span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c1"><a class="c14" href="#h.3whwml4">Consumer Action and Individual Behavioral Change</a></span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c1"><a class="c14" href="#h.2bn6wsx">Institutional Reform</a></span></p><p class="c27"><span class="c1"><a class="c14" href="#h.qsh70q">Potential Items for Further Study</a></span></p><p class="c41"><span class="c1"><a class="c14" href="#h.3as4poj">Selected Bibliography</a></span></p><p class="c31 c5"><span class="c29 c8"></span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><h1 class="c26" id="h.q2sgq1688t8r"><span class="c18">Introduction</span></h1><p class="c6"><span class="c0">One definition of Fair Trade, jointly agreed by several international Fair Trade organizations, is: </span></p><p class="c6 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6 c34"><span>[A] trading partnership, based on dialogue, transparency and respect, that seeks greater equity in international trade. It contributes to sustainable development by offering better trading conditions to, and securing the rights of, marginalized producers and workers&mdash;especially in the South. Fair trade organisations (backed by consumers) are engaged actively in supporting producers, awareness raising and in campaigning for changes in the rules and practice of conventional international trade.</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt1" id="ftnt_ref1">[1]</a></sup></p><p class="c6 c5 c34"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span>The nonprofits, activists, and mission-driven businesses promoting this kind of trading partnership comprise the &ldquo;Fair Trade movement.&rdquo;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt2" id="ftnt_ref2">[2]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span>The Fair Trade movement&rsquo;s intended beneficiaries are &ldquo;disadvantaged producers&rdquo; in the Global South.</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt3" id="ftnt_ref3">[3]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;Fairtrade International (also known as Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International or FLO), summarizes that, for participating producers, Fair Trade means: </span></p><ul class="c23 lst-kix_list_2-0 start"><li class="c6 c11 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Prices that aim to cover the average costs of producing their crop sustainably &ndash; a vital safety net when market prices drop</span></li><li class="c6 c11 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">The Fairtrade Premium &ndash; an extra sum of money paid on top of the selling price to invest in business or community projects of their choice</span></li><li class="c6 c11 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Decent working conditions and a ban on discrimination, forced labour and child labour</span></li><li class="c6 c11 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Access to advance credit ahead of harvest time</span></li><li class="c6 c11 li-bullet-0"><span>Being able to plan more for the future with more security and stronger relationships with buyers.&rdquo;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt4" id="ftnt_ref4">[4]</a></sup></li></ul><p class="c6 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span>Consumers and institutions in the Global North are the key audience of the Fair Trade movement.

Although there are differences between the Fair Trade movement and other social movements focused on moral circle expansion, such as the farmed animal movement, these other movements can glean some strategic insight about which strategies are most effective from the history of Fair Trade.</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt6" id="ftnt_ref6">[6]</a></sup></p><p class="c6 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span>This case study has a broader geographic focus than Sentience Institute&rsquo;s previous four social movement case studies,</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt7" id="ftnt_ref7">[7]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;primarily because there is often limited evidence or information about Fair Trade in individual countries.

This is similar to the usage by sociologist William Gamson, who defined success for social movement organizations in terms of either &ldquo;acceptance&rdquo; by their antagonists or &ldquo;new advantages&rdquo; accrued for their intended beneficiaries; &ldquo;co-optation&rdquo; (co-option) is where an organization or movement achieves &ldquo;acceptance&rdquo; but not &ldquo;new advantages.&rdquo;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt9" id="ftnt_ref9">[9]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;The terms &ldquo;Global North&rdquo; and &ldquo;Global South&rdquo; are used, following recent scholarly usage.</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt10" id="ftnt_ref10">[10]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;The meaning is similar to the terms &ldquo;developed&rdquo; and &ldquo;developing&rdquo;; the former category contains North America, Europe, Australia, and a handful of other countries (such as Japan, South Korea, and Israel), while the latter term includes most of Asia, Central America, South America, and Africa. &ldquo;Northern&rdquo; and &ldquo;Southern&rdquo; are used as the adjectives for these terms.</span></p><p class="c6 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span>From the 1990s, coffee became an important part of the Fair Trade movement&rsquo;s product mix.</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt11" id="ftnt_ref11">[11]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;Many scholars focus primarily on coffee when evaluating the Fair Trade movement.</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt12" id="ftnt_ref12">[12]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;Given the greater availability of evidence and analysis for this product type, sometimes this report discusses Fair Trade coffee assuming that it is fairly representative of Fair Trade foodstuffs more widely.
