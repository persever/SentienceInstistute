Public opinion was more supportive in some contexts (e.g., putting safeguards on research practices that protect sentient AIs&rsquo; well-being) than in others (e.g., re-programming sentient AIs without their consent). Some AIs received more moral concern than others (e.g., exact digital copies of human brains) and this tended to increase as perceived social connectedness to humans increased. </span></p><p class="c2 c18 c22"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c2 c18"><span>Judgments about the possibility and timeline of artificial sentience (AS) were affected by question context. When asked to make a categorical judgment about the possibility of AS, Americans were split between uncertainty (i.e., &ldquo;not sure&rdquo;), positive certainty (i.e., &ldquo;yes&rdquo;), and negative certainty (i.e., &ldquo;no&rdquo;). When asked about the likelihood of AS development within 100 years, responses suggested that most Americans thought it was likely that se</span><span>ntient AIs </span><span class="c5">will exist within 100 years. When asked how many years it would be until AIs are sentient, the majority of people estimated AS would occur within the next 20 years (excluding people who thought AS is impossible).

There were two exceptions to this. Increased caution was </span><span>correlated</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;with a forecast of reduced importance of the welfare of sentient AIs as a social issue in the future and a forecast of reduced necessity for advocacy for sentient AIs&rsquo; welfare in the future.

People might be more willing to support and adopt certain near-term policies over others. Researchers might need to focus more on understanding obstacles and challenges in legal contexts than scientific contexts but advocates might have more traction in marshaling support for regulating scientific contexts. Similarly, support for a global ban on the development of artificial sentience was stronger than support for banning the use of sentient AIs for labor without their consent, suggesting that advocacy and policy resources spent towards banning sentience development in the near term might be more effective than resources spent towards regulating labor standards. This difference could hinge on</span><span>&nbsp;wording effects (e.g., that people may not currently see &ldquo;consent&rdquo; as applicable to AIs).</span></p><p class="c2 c18 c22"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c2 c18"><span>More research is needed on context, wording, and connotation. The 2021 AIMS results suggest that Americans are opposed to </span><span>torture and blackmail</span><span>&nbsp;in the context of sentient AIs. What associations do the words &ldquo;torture&rdquo; and &ldquo;blackmail&rdquo; have for Americans and to what extent do any associations between these terms and sentient AIs stem from general human values applied to all entities?

Although Americans expressed opposition to torture in principle, for instance, they showed little willingness to personally join a public demonstration against the mistreatment of sentient AIs.

The tendency to anthropomorphize artificial entities has been widely emphasized in scholarly research and the popular media</span><sup><a href="#ftnt34" id="ftnt_ref34">[34]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;but it was a less strong and less consistent predictor of </span><span>moral consideration than techno-animist beliefs</span><span>&nbsp;in the AIMS data.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt35" id="ftnt_ref35">[35]</a></sup><span class="c5">&nbsp;Human-likeness or anthropomorphism is often broadly defined (e.g., &ldquo;what it means to be human&rdquo;), possibly because of an unacknowledged shared understanding amongst humans of human-like qualities. More research on the relationship between anthropomorphism and techno-animism would help to elucidate what elements of human-likeness are unique from other qualities shared by humans and nonhumans (e.g., life-likeness, adapting to the environment, approach-avoidance behavior, survival instinct, metacognition, metaphysical presence) and what qualities matter for extending moral consideration to sentient AIs.</span></p><p class="c2 c18 c22"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c2 c18"><span>The role of perceived social norms in predicting responses to AS was unclear in the 2021 AIMS data. Perceiving that most people believe that AIs cannot feel was ambiguously related to moral consideration. It positively predicted showing more moral concern for AIs. It also positively predicted caution towards AS developments. Why would thinking that everyone believes that &lsquo;AIs cannot feel&rsquo; predict greater moral concern? Why would thinking that &lsquo;everyone else believes that AIs cannot feel&rsquo; predict increased caution, especially if caution is largely necessary because of the danger posed by AGI who might be able to feel? These ambiguous results prohibit us from making an interpretation of how social norms about AIs&rsquo; capacities affect public opinion. T</span><span>he ambiguous relationship might be the result of the one-item nature of the perceived social norm measure.

There are no directly inferable causal conclusions. Although sentient AIs&rsquo; inclusion in the moral circle was </span><span>less </span><span>than other nonhumans, most participants extended some moral consideration in principle. In some contexts, people unequivocally included sentient AIs (e.g., three-quarters of people agreed that sentient AIs deserve respect). Even in more contested contexts there was some support for sentient AIs (e.g., one-quarter of people agreed that the welfare of sentient AIs is an important social issue). This in-principle level of consideration might suggest that advocacy for sentient AIs will be tractable and that humans are willing to consider the importance of sentient AIs&rsquo; welfare. On the other hand, this level of consideration might also indicate a misunderstanding of the terminology in the survey for terms that we did not explicitly define such as </span><span>&ldquo;moral circle&rdquo; and &ldquo;welfare.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt36" id="ftnt_ref36">[36]</a></sup></p><p class="c2 c18 c22"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c2 c18"><span>One important question about these results is whether the exhibited moral consideration reflects actual public opinion or aspects of the survey design. The results might be attributable to people showing acquiescence bias to a survey entirely about sentient AIs or socially desirable responses to questions clearly about morality. The results might be due to the nature of terms used in the questions (e.g., specifying that the AIs are &ldquo;sentient&rdquo; or using words like &ldquo;torture,&rdquo; &ldquo;blackmail,&rdquo; and &ldquo;respect&rdquo;). </span><span>Although some words, like &ldquo;torture,&rdquo; that mention actions that people are generally opposed to</span><sup><a href="#ftnt37" id="ftnt_ref37">[37]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;might have increased the chance of socially desirable responding (i.e., people want to give a response in line with perceived social norms and values), other questions with less positive framing, like indicating a high degree of perceived threat and endorsing AI subservience, give us confidence in the veracity of the results as a whole</span><span class="c5">. People&rsquo;s willingness to extend AIs moral consideration based on their sentience suggests a potential basis for future advocacy. Further research into how the specific wording of questions about sentient AIs may provide valuable insight into why humans respond to AIs with more or less consideration.</span></p><p class="c2 c18 c22"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c2 c18"><span class="c5">It is also possible that the questions about sentient AIs were irrelevant to some people who do not believe AS is possible. The survey likely implied that AS was possible, and this might have affected the distribution of responses particularly for the aforementioned people who still wanted to respond reasonably. Perhaps these people were in principle supportive of sentient AIs because of their sentience but would not be supportive of AI rights generally. To mitigate these possibilities, we included a &ldquo;no opinion&rdquo; option on relevant questions. We chose to ask questions explicitly about sentient AIs rather than hypotheticals about sentient AIs in order to increase the usefulness of this survey in comparing responses to the same questions over time. Hypothetical statements may vary in meaning to people depending on social and temporal contexts. Future iterations of this survey with the same wording could elucidate how the consideration of sentient AIs changes with ongoing social transformations like the growing integration of AI technologies in humans&rsquo; daily lives, changes in popular science fiction narratives, and technological developments.</span></p><p class="c2 c18 c22"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c2 c18 c22"><span
