The best counterarguments to this are that preservationist and anti-interventionist farmed animal advocacy could reduce willingness to act to reduce wild animal suffering, and that technology could lead to a faster end of animal farming, making it happen before value lock-in events such as AI takeoff.</span></li><li class="c8 c11 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Social change driven by self-interest or the interests of the inner moral circle, such as appeals to the nutritional benefits of plant-based food or to the preservation of the environment for one&rsquo;s children, may have outcomes no better than a technological change trajectory.</span></li><li class="c8 c11 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Very different rates of change in different regions may lead to increased conflict or reduced cooperation.</span></li></ul><p class="c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8"><span>These arguments have slightly updated me towards thinking </span><span>socially driven trajectories</span><span>&nbsp;are better for long-term outcomes than technologically driven trajectories, and towards thinking that the trajectory is an important strategic consideration.</span></p><h1 class="c15" id="h.nlotj46zyowu"><span>Which trajectory are we on?</span></h1><p class="c8"><span>Some argue we are set to end animal farming, perhaps by </span><span class="c2"><a class="c5" href="https://news.uchicago.edu/big-brains-podcast-impossible-foods-ceo-pat-brown-meat-industry-plant-based-vegetarian">2035</a></span><span>&nbsp;or </span><span class="c2"><a class="c5" href="https://jacyanthis.com/book">2100</a></span><span>.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt3" id="ftnt_ref3">[3]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;The median estimate by users of </span><span class="c2"><a class="c5" href="https://www.metaculus.com/">Metaculus</a></span><span>, a popular prediction platform, for when the number of concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFO) in the US will decline to 90% of their 2020 levels is </span><span class="c2"><a class="c5" href="https://www.metaculus.com/questions/7319/date-of-decline-of-cafos-by-90/">2067</a></span><span>.

The estimated proportion of vegans and vegetarians even within a single country varies greatly between surveys due to differences in sampling and wording, such as social desirability bias and different ways of asking for self-reported diet, which is also more prone to inaccuracy than direct measurement (e.g., purchase history).</span><sup><a href="#ftnt4" id="ftnt_ref4">[4]</a></sup></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8"><span>The proportion of animal rights activists is more difficult to find an estimate of over time but also appears to have increased substantially, such as the </span><span class="c2"><a class="c5" href="https://animalcharityevaluators.org/research/reports/allocation-of-movement-resources/">budgets of animal rights organizations</a></span><span>. The growth and development of plant-based food technology and cellular agriculture has been substantial in the past decade. </span><span>The market share of plant-based milk alternatives grew by 9% from 2017&ndash;18, and as of 2018, plant-based milk represents </span><span class="c2"><a class="c5" href="https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/plant-based-milk-market-102285">15% of the total market share of milk</a></span><span>.

There are many actions we can take that intuitively fit as both social and technological, and as with most dichotomies, it can be conceptualized as a multidimensional gradient, though a detailed embedding is beyond the scope of this post.

Both social and technological factors are certainly at play. </span><span>If the social and technological trends continue at their current rates,</span><span>&nbsp;my overall impression based on experience in the field is that</span><span>&nbsp;we are currently on a technological</span><span>ly driven</span><span>&nbsp;trajectory towards the end of animal farming.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt7" id="ftnt_ref7">[7]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;This is supported by slow, if any, growth of vegetarianism, and the rapid growth of plant-based food technology such as </span><span class="c2"><a class="c5" href="https://www.beyondmeat.com/en-US/">Beyond Meat</a></span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span class="c2"><a class="c5" href="https://impossiblefoods.com/">Impossible Foods</a></span><span>&nbsp;and cellular agriculture such as </span><span class="c2"><a class="c5" href="https://upsidefoods.com/">Upside Foods</a></span><span>.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>However, this does not account for interactions between social and technological factors, such as increased access to animal product alternatives making social change easier.</span></p><h2 class="c7" id="h.f1m2q1p7z0gz"><span class="c12 c14">Social change factors</span></h2><p class="c8"><span>Most stories of moral progress are described as socially driven trajectories, such as the civil rights and </span><span>women&#39;s suffrage</span><span>&nbsp;movements. </span><span>Animal farming may go through a similar shift, but there are </span><span>numerous disanalogies between such movements</span><span>, such as that</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c2"><a class="c5" href="https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/blog/social-movement-case-studies-methodology">animals can&rsquo;t advocate for themselves</a></span><span>&nbsp;in the way many oppressed humans have.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8"><span>Several social changes already seem to be improving attitudes towards animals, such as an increase in urbanization and pet ownership.

In </span><span class="c0"><a class="c5" href="http://jacyanthis.com/book">The End of Animal Farming</a></span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">(2018), Jacy Reese Anthis writes that, &ldquo;As wealth increased and horses made way for cars, city dwellers may have owned pets to show off their wealth or to fill the emotional gaps left by a lack of working animals, relatives, and close friends in the city.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8"><span>Other social change factors may include spillover from areas unrelated to animals, such as increased concern for other humans. Steven Pinker in </span><span class="c0"><a class="c5" href="https://stevenpinker.com/publications/better-angels-our-nature">Better Angels of our Nature</a></span><span>&nbsp;(2012)</span><span class="c17">&nbsp;</span><span>argues that violence is declining over time;</span><span>&nbsp;this trend </span><span class="c2"><a class="c5" href="https://qz.com/1209936/our-treatment-of-animals-is-stalling-human-progress">might not hold</a></span><span>&nbsp;with violence towards animals in agricultur</span><span class="c1">e, though it may hold in attitudes towards animals not used as commodities such as companion animals.</span></p><h2 class="c7" id="h.am5f8cwsjeei"><span class="c12 c14">Technological change factors</span></h2><p class="c8"><span>Numerous moral victories appear to have been won primarily through technological change, such as the automobile and other technological advances </span><span>largely replacing the use of horses</span><span>&nbsp;in transport and farming (</span><span class="c2"><a class="c5" href="https://books.google.com.au/books?hl%3Den%26lr%3D%26id%3D8qAuDwAAQBAJ%26oi">Levin 2017</a></span><span>) and the replacement of wood heaters with modern heating </span><span>reducing the number of deaths</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>due to air pollution (</span><span class="c2"><a class="c5" href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00036846.2017.1349292">Xue 2017</a></span><span>)</span><span class="c1">. The consumption of animal products may go through similarly rapid decline.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8"><span>Plant-based food technology and cellular agriculture may end animal farming by displacing animal products. This seems plausible due to</span><span>&nbsp;the </span><span class="c2"><a class="c5" href="https://awellfedworld.org/feed-ratios/">inefficiency of animal products</a></span><span>, such that more efficient ways of producing the same or similar end products may win out for economic reasons</span><span>.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt8" id="ftnt_ref8">[8]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;It is also possible that such efficiency gains will not persist, leading to recidivism back into animal agriculture.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8"><span>Simply </span><span>eating animal products</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>reduces attribution of mind to animals (</span><span class="c2"><a class="c5" href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2011.04.020">Bratanova et al. 2011</a></span><span>; </span><span class="c2"><a class="c5" href="https://doi.org/10.1177/0146167211424291">Bastian et al. 2011</a></span><span>)</span><span class="c1">.

In this case, while some hens may have lived better lives during those 6 years, no hens are living in better housing due to this campaign after 6 years. In this case, other moral progress (e.g. cage-free campaigns in other countries) would continue in either scenario, leading to a positive slope in either scenario. Slope rubber banding could occur if the cage-free campaign inspires campaigns in other countries, and that inspiration is met with equal and opposite reversion, but the original cage-free switch is not reverted. In that case, the progress will continue to increase moral value accrued over time by those hens living better lives, but the value produced in year 10 would be no more than the value produced in year 7.
