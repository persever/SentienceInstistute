This is unlike discussions of</span><span>&nbsp;&ldquo;consciousness&rdquo; and &ldquo;sentience,&rdquo; where </span><span>I</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;see a lot of wasted resources spent on and moral decisions based on these properties being discoverable.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s an interesting argument that consciousness doesn&rsquo;t exist. But I have a better argument that consciousness exists. In fact, I have first-person experience that consciousness exists. This is superior to any logical or empirical argument.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>I&rsquo;m not denying your first-person experience</span><span>. </span><span>Your first-person experience is an interesting and important feature of the world</span><span>. If that&rsquo;s all you mean when you argue consciousness exists, then I&rsquo;m in full agreement. But usually people think of consciousness as a broader set of things in the world that is at least happening in the brains of billions of humans, if not also in many nonhuman animals. </span><span>That broader set is not something of which you (or I) could possibly have first-person experiences, unless you&rsquo;re suggesting some kind of mental connection between you and all of those other beings that enables you to experience their experiences.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">But I am sympathetic to the strong intuition felt by many people that the broader set exists. I&rsquo;ve felt that intuition too! However, I&rsquo;ve since cast it off for two reasons.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>First, I don&rsquo;t think humans have reliable intuitions about this kind of deep question. Humans didn&rsquo;t evolve making judgments of and getting feedback on our answers to deep questions like the nature of sentience, quantum physics, molecular biology, or any other field that wasn&rsquo;t involved in the day-to-day life of our distant ancestors. And you probably haven&rsquo;t had the opportunity to develop reliable intuitions to deep </span><span>questions</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;during your lifetime, though if you&rsquo;ve spent years studying philosophy or similar disciplines, then perhaps you&rsquo;ve developed some decent intuitions on these topics.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Second, I think there&rsquo;s good reason to expect us to have an intuition that consciousness exists even if that&rsquo;s not true. The idea of an objective property of consciousness is in line with a variety of intuitions humans have about their own superiority and special place in the universe. We tend to underestimate the mental capacities of nonhuman animals; we struggle to accept our own inevitable deaths; and even with respect to other humans, most of us suffer from the </span><span>Dunning&ndash;Kruger</span><span>&nbsp;effect: We believe our cognitive ability is better than it actually is. </span><span>Consciousness realism is the same sort of phenomenon: it places our mental lives in a distinct, special category, which is something we strongly desire, but a desire for something to be true doesn&rsquo;t make it true!</span></p><h3 class="c15" id="h.6auw1enj3fbr"><span class="c16">Moving forward with sentience research.</span></h3><p class="c1"><span>My view here fortunately</span><sup><a href="#ftnt12" id="ftnt_ref12">[12]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;doesn&rsquo;t curtail the development of a deeper understanding of sentience or consciousness, </span><span>nor does it curtail our ability to make progress on better understanding exactly which beings should be included in our moral circles.</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;In fact, it facilities this. If we&rsquo;re stuck on consciousness being a real phenomenon, we&rsquo;ll tend to waste a ton of effort musing about its existence or directly looking for it in the universe.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>There&rsquo;s an unfortunate cyclical effect here: our misguided intuition fuels vague terminology and causes philosophers and scientists to work hard to justify that intuition &mdash; as they have for centuries &mdash; which then enables a continuation of that misguided intuition. </span><span>I believe that if we can get past this mental roadblock and accept the imprecision of our current terminology</span><span>, accept that there is no objective truth to consciousness as it&rsquo;s currently defined, then we can make meaningful progress on the two questions that are actually very real and important: </span><span>What exactly are the features of various organisms and artificial beings, and which exact features do we morally care about?</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>If we want to call those features, or some other set of features, &ldquo;sentience,&rdquo; that could be similar to, though not as elegant as, the way we started using &ldquo;gold&rdquo; to refer to an element with a certain atomic number that roughly mapped onto the proto-scientific vague definition of &ldquo;gold.&rdquo; But we could also drop the term, the way we&rsquo;ve eliminated &ldquo;</span><span class="c8">&eacute;lan vital</span><span>&rdquo; in favor of discussing specific biological features.</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;I don&rsquo;t have a strong view on the best rhetorical strategy.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Cataloguing mental features and refining our moral views on them might be a project</span><span>&nbsp;Sentience Institute tackles in the future,</span><sup><a href="#ftnt13" id="ftnt_ref13">[13]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;though as stated earlier, it seems we have a good enough understanding of them right now for the purpose of advocating for the rights and welfare of farmed animals, wild animals, and artificial beings if they are at some point </span><span>evaluated to be sentient (defined via moral concern)</span><span>. Even in the case of artificial sentience, we don&rsquo;t need to have an exact understanding of the features sentient artificial beings will have in order to advocate on their behalf. Because our moral circle is currently very restrictive, advocating for its expansion gets us closer to the proper size, even if we&rsquo;re not sure exactly what that is</span><span>.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>There are also two important implications of eliminativism outside of sentience research. First, it reduces the likelihood of moral convergence because one way moral convergence can happen is if humanity discovers which beings are sentient and that serves as our criterion for moral consideration. This then should makes us more pessimistic about the expected moral value of the far future given humanity&rsquo;s continued existence, which then makes reducing extinction risk a </span><span class="c4"><a class="c6" href="http://effective-altruism.com/ea/1l0/why_i_prioritize_moral_circle_expansion_over/">less promising strategy</a></span><span class="c2">&nbsp;for doing good.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Second, it seems to usually increase the moral weight people place on small and weird minds, such as insects and simple artificial beings. This is because when you see sentience as a discoverable, real property in the world, you tend to care about all features of various beings (neurophysiology, behavior, but also physical appearance, evolutionary distance from humans, substrate, etc.) because these are all analogical evidence of sentience. However, if you see sentience as a vague property that&rsquo;s up to us to specify, then you tend to care less about the features that seem less morally relevant in themselves (e.g. physical appearance, evolutionary distance). If an insect has the capacity for reinforcement learning, moods like anxiety, and integration of mental processes, then the eliminativist is more free to just say, &ldquo;Okay, that&rsquo;s a being I care about. My moral evaluation could change based on more empirical evidence, but those mental features are things I want to include as some level of sentience.&rdquo; In other words, eliminativism places a burden on people who want to deny animal sentience. They more need to point to a specific, testable mental feature that those animals lack.<br><br>These implications of the eliminativism question make me see it as one of the most important theoretical questions in Sentience Institute&rsquo;s purview.</span></p><hr class="c17"><div><p class="c7"><a href="#ftnt_ref1" id="ftnt1">[1]</a><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c4"><a class="c6" href="https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/animal-farming-attitudes-survey-2017">https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/animal-farming-attitudes-survey-2017</a></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Another survey: </span><span class="c4 c3"><a class="c6" href="http://cratefreefuture.com/pdf/American%252520Farm%252520Bureau-Funded%252520Poll.pdf">http://cratefreefuture.com/pdf/American%2520Farm%2520Bureau-Funded%2520Poll.pdf</a></span></p></div><div><p class="c7"><a href="#ftnt_ref2" id="ftnt2">[2]</a><span class="c3">&nbsp;See, for example, </span><span class="c4 c3"><a class="c6" href="http://fcmconference.org/img/CambridgeDeclarationOnConsciousness.pdf">http://fcmconference.org/img/CambridgeDeclarationOnConsciousness.pdf</a></span></p></div><div><p class="c7"><a href="#ftnt_ref3" id="ftnt3">[3]</a><span class="c3">&nbsp;Other terms to refer to these experiences are &ldquo;affective,&rdquo; &ldquo;valence,&rdquo; and &ldquo;</span><span class="c3">motivational</span><span class="c0">.&rdquo; Of course all of these terms are somewhat imprecise.</span></p></div><div><p class="c7"><a href="#ftnt_ref4" id="ftnt4">[4]</a><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c3"><a class="c6" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/16/opinion/consciousness-isnt-a-mystery-its-matter.html">Attributed</a></span><span class="c0">&nbsp;to Ned Block.</span></p></div><div><p class="c7"><a href="#ftnt_ref5" id="ftnt5">[5]</a><span class="c0">&nbsp;I think insofar as these definitions are substantive, they basically all boil down to some combination of the three listed above.</span></p></div><div><p class="c7"><a href="#ftnt_ref6" id="ftnt6">[6]</a><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">One might say that consciousness is undiscoverable in this sense, but still a reality.

Take an example like a physical feature of the universe that&rsquo;s too large to ever be computed even with the largest supercomputer physically possible. My physics knowledge isn&rsquo;t good enough to know if there&rsquo;s a direct feature, such as the number of atoms in the universe, but we can at least apply arbitrarily large math to make this the case, such as 3^^^^^^3 with however many ^s you need. In this case, the decimal representation seems undiscoverable, but </span><span class="c3">does it exist</span><span class="c3">? Is it real?
