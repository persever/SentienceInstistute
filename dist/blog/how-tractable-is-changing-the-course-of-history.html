By this logic, the important question for those seeking to maximize their impact is not just, &ldquo;How tractable is changing the course of history?&rdquo; but &ldquo;How tractable is it </span><span>for thoughtful actors to change the course of history in their intended direction</span><span>?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c9"><span>This post is primarily focused on assessing the extent to which a small group of thoughtful actors, such as a single animal advocacy nonprofit, can deliberately change the course of history, such as to encourage </span><span>moral circle expansion</span><span>&nbsp;(MCE); increasing the number of sentient beings whose interests are considered in our legal systems and social norms. This deliberate influence</span><span>, shortened as &ldquo;historical tractability,&rdquo;</span><span>&nbsp;is contrasted with three other sources of change: (1) long-term trends, (2) luck, and (3) </span><span>deliberate yet hard-to-influence</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;efforts.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c9"><span>Social change would be </span><span>less tractable </span><span>if its causes were slow-moving and long-term, or only had an indirect relationship to change.

There have been similar moves towards compromise in sociology between structuralism and its critics. I don&rsquo;t find any of these theories especially compelling, and given the unresolved academic debates on these issues, it seems more justified to use them as analytical frameworks that can be used with particular case studies rather than to consider them to be consistently accurate generalizations. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c9"><span>Majority opinion among historians of World War I has oscillated between holding the actions of national leaders (especially in Germany) responsible for the outbreak of war, and emphasizing the importance of longer-term factors outside of their direct control. There is now an increased acceptance of the importance of </span><span>various contingent factors such as the success or failure of the assassination of Franz Ferdinand and the negotiations in July 1914. </span><span>Although I have not read the primary evidence myself and so do not hold confident views, it seems plausible that changes in these contingent factors would have prevented </span><span>war</span><span>.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt6" id="ftnt_ref6">[6]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;Historians seem to accept the importance of a variety of causes of the French Revolution. From my understanding of the evidence, it seems that w</span><span>hile the occurrence of some sort of radical social change in France in the 18th and 19th centuries wasn&rsquo;t as dependent on contingency as the outbreak of World War I, the precise path and outcomes of the Revolution were. From an effective altruism perspective, the precise path might not be very important, but it is possible that this could have dramatically altered the outcomes of the Revolution.</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;It seems unlikely that the development of the industrial revolution depended much on contingency given the long-term forces at play, although other forms of trajectory change may still have been tractable. In several of the included historical case studies, notably with the rise of US environmentalism in the 1960s, the apparent influence of certain intellectuals suggests that their ideas might be more important than luck or subsequent decision-making processes in shaping broad developments.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c3">These case case studies also provide evidence of the importance of long-term, indirect factors that might reduce tractability, though this is not so much the case with World War I (depending on how much confidence one places in recent arguments in favor of contingency).</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c3">Empirical studies by social movement sociologists show that social movements and individual organizations have succeeded in having an impact but that this is difficult and usually only achieved with the support of public opinion and/or allies in the political system.

The direct-effect model maintains that movements can have a positive impact on policy with their own forces and in the absence of external support. The indirect-effect model sees movements as having an impact following a two-stage process, first by influencing certain aspects of their external environment&mdash;specifically, political alliances and public opinion&mdash;and then by allowing the latter to influence policy. The joint-effect model states that movement impact is forthcoming when political allies or a favorable public opinion (or both) combine with movement mobilization. Furthermore, he distinguishes between three variants of the joint-effect model, depending on the specific combination of these factors.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt189" id="ftnt_ref189">[189]</a></sup></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c9"><span>Giugni&rsquo;s time series analysis comparison of the ecology, anti-nuclear, and peace movements in the US, Italy, and Switzerland found that &ldquo;the indirect-effect model, in particular, was found not to be very powerful. In contrast, some limited direct impact can be observed.&rdquo; Unsurprisingly, &ldquo;All three types of joint effect [protest combined with political alliances, favourable public opinion, or both] are stronger than either the direct or indirect effect.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt190" id="ftnt_ref190">[190]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;A later reanalysis, using different comparative methods, concluded that &ldquo;based on the results of the QCA, social movements seem to impact policy only when assisted by other factors. In none of the three policy domains and in none of the three countries does mobilization alone trigger policy change,&rdquo; and &ldquo;that environmental policy is the only policy domain for which social movement mobilization is part of the necessary conditions for explaining change.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt191" id="ftnt_ref191">[191]</a></sup></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c9"><span>This conclusion is supported by Felix Kolb, who suggests in his literature review that some of the conflicting implications of empirical studies focusing on the size of organizations might stem from insufficiently complex research designs and notes that those that are sufficiently complex suggest that &ldquo;as long as political opportunities are not available, movements are doomed to fail no matter how strong they are.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt192" id="ftnt_ref192">[192]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;This suggests that external factors are more influential than internal factors, and Kolb&rsquo;s own comparative analysis of the European anti-nuclear movement supports this.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt193" id="ftnt_ref193">[193]</a></sup></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c9"><span>Similarly, Amenta et al. found that from the 45 articles published 2001-2009 on social movement impacts that they analyzed, in &ldquo;47 of the 50 instances in which there was a significantly positive movement effect, the influence was mediated.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt194" id="ftnt_ref194">[194]</a></sup></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c9"><span>Kolb and Giugni present the most rigorous analyses of the interaction between social movement mobilization and external constraints across different movements and contexts that I have seen, and alongside Amenta et al.&rsquo;s meta-analysis, both authors suggest that social movement impact is very rare or impossible without at least either public support or favourable political opportunities. This therefore suggests that social change is dependent upon the successful manipulation of indirect factors, and therefore less tractable than we might otherwise assume. Kolb argues that &ldquo;not all types of political opportunity can be created by social movements for their own benefit. However, even the political institutional structure of a country, which by definition pretends to be stable and durable, can be altered by protest.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt195" id="ftnt_ref195">[195]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;This </span><span>allows </span><span class="c3">for influence from thoughtful actors, even if change is slow.</span></p><h2 class="c20" id="h.f0c1tptkijt8"><span class="c12">The importance of leaders</span></h2><p class="c9"><span class="c3">Social scientists &mdash; notably economists &mdash; have used data to understand the importance of various types of leaders in influencing social change.

For some time the field has been roughly divided between a dominant, structural approach that emphasizes economic resources, political structures, formal organizations, and social networks and a cultural or constructionist tradition, drawn partly from symbolic interactionism, which focuses on frames, identities, meanings, and emotions. The gaps and misunderstandings between the two sides - as well as the efforts to bridge these perspectives - closely parallel those in the discipline of sociology at large, with such approaches as Marxism or systems theory on the one hand and micro-sociological, constructionist approaches such as interactionism, pragmatism, and ethnomethodology on the other</span><span class="c5">.&rdquo;</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;They do, however, see &ldquo;the more structural school&rdquo; as &ldquo;dominant now for thirty years</span><span class="c5">,&quot;</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;while &ldquo;the constructionist school, on the other hand, has been more content to develop useful concepts that anyone could use than with self-conscious comparisons or syntheses of different </span><span class="c5">traditions</span><span class="c2">&hellip; cultural approaches have often been subsumed under the supposed political process consensus, especially in the form of &ldquo;frames&rdquo; and &ldquo;identities&rdquo; vii-viii.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5">Note that Charles Kurzman </span><span class="c5">disagrees </span><span class="c2">with this characterisation and suggests that there is a &ldquo;constructionist consensus;&rdquo; see footnote 23.</span></p></div><div><p class="c4"><a href="#ftnt_ref29" id="ftnt29">[29]</a><span class="c5">&nbsp;For a summary, see E</span><span class="c5">dward L.

The political sphere, in turn, controls society; crucially, however, the primary means of this control is ideological&hellip; Social reform or transformation can be achieved and, indeed, can only be achieved, through counter-ideologies that arise from the social sphere, the one sector not dominated by the economically based elites.

McCloskey (1991) acknowledged as well that it is impossible to know whether many systems are linear or not. Still, McCloskey opined that history may well be chaotic and suggested a few anecdotical qualitative examples from the historiography of the Civil War in the United States. But though it seems likely that the exact course of some of the events of the US Civil War may have been sensitive to initial conditions, McCloskey did not prove that something similar would not have been brought about by different initial conditions and certainly neither McCloskey nor Reisch introduced the kind of mathematical modeling that scientists associate with chaos.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5">Aviezer Tucker, &ldquo;Historiographical Counterfactuals and Historical Contingency,&quot; </span><span class="c6 c5">History and Theory</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;32, no. 2 (May 1999), 269, cites Yemima Ben-Menahem, &ldquo;Historical Contingency,&rdquo; </span><span class="c6 c5">Ratio </span><span class="c2">10 (1997), 102, as not committing herself to the application of chaos theory to history: &ldquo;the sensitivity of historical events to initial conditions may or may not be as radical as that of chaotic phenomena, but it can certainly be very significant.&rdquo;</span></p></div><div><p class="c4"><a href="#ftnt_ref37" id="ftnt37">[37]</a><span class="c5">&nbsp;Chaos theory has been used to improve predictions in real life settings, such as in weather forecasting.

But, the crown also unleashed decentralizing impulses. Most notably, it repeatedly sold venal offices in government posts and thereby seriously undercut the process of unification by parceling out government functions to the highest bidder&hellip; The government&rsquo;s oscillation between centralizing tendencies that undermined privilege and decentralizing measures that reinforced other dimensions of privilege gave rise to a &lsquo;group individualism&rsquo; in which social groups were seemingly as concerned about their prerogatives as ever, but, in fact had become more homogenous in outlook as a whole.

For Baker, social practice was not determined by one overarching discourse, but was conditioned by multiple, interacting ones. In a well-known article, he argued that the old regime was characterized by three discourses, of justice, reason, and will, each of which lent different inflections to the meaning of sovereignty. Justice was associated with the parlements&rsquo; defense of the rights and duties associated with the traditional social hierarchy, whereas reason was more often espoused by ministerial reformers seeking to rationalize the social order by curbing the role of privilege and diversity of legal practices. During the Revolution, the discourse of will, which was identified with Rousseau&rsquo;s theory of popular sovereignty, triumphed and pointed the revolutionaries in the direction of the Terror. More recently, Baker has also offered perspectives on discourses of republicanism and &lsquo;society&rsquo; that went beyond this original trio&rdquo; (citing Keith Baker, </span><span class="c6 c5">Inventing the French Revolution</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;(Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1990), especially 109-27). 1314-23 summarizes the influence of &ldquo;Cultural History, the &lsquo;Linguistic Turn&rsquo;, and the Public Sphere&rdquo; on the historiography: &ldquo;historians searching for cultural origins of the Revolution, therefore, have generally not been interested in tracing the diffusion of ideas from the pens of a few prolific philosophes. Rather they hoped to uncover the far more complex formation of authoritative discourses that allowed sections of society to envision alternative forms of social organization and political power.&rdquo;</span></p></div><div><p class="c4"><a href="#ftnt_ref86" id="ftnt86">[86]</a><span class="c5">&nbsp;See </span><span class="c5">footnote 82</span><span class="c2">.</span></p></div><div><p class="c4"><a href="#ftnt_ref87" id="ftnt87">[87]</a><span class="c5">&nbsp;Gwynne Lewis, </span><span class="c6 c5">The French Revolution: Rethinking the Debate</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;(London: Routledge, 2003; first published 1999), 8, notes that &ldquo; Marxist historians such as Albert Soboul certainly posited an indirect relationship between the widely perceived growth of capitalism and the intellectual &lsquo;take-off&rsquo; of the Enlightenment&hellip; For marxisant scholars, socio-economic change provides the soil in which the seeds of the Enlightenment could germinate.&rdquo; </span></p></div><div><p class="c4"><a href="#ftnt_ref88" id="ftnt88">[88]</a><span class="c2">&nbsp;Examples include Edmund Burke and Albert Sorel.

Uncommonly shrewd and lucky political, financial, and social decisions by the monarchy and its ministers over the course of the 18th century might have been able to stave off change as far-reaching as that achieved in 1789-1815 by 50 years (90% credible interval 10 to 250 years).

Articles in the median social science journal, on average, get only 0.5 citations within two years of publication (Klamer and Dalen 2002). The mean number of citations per article in mathematics, physics, and environmental science journals is probably less than 1 (Mansilla et al. 2007). By contrast, the top 0.1% of papers in the Institute for Scientific Information have been cited over 1000 times (Redner 1998). Citations per paper are basically distributed by a power law, which means that only a few papers dominate. This trend seems to hold across fields, even when the average number of citations per article varies widely (Radicchi, Fortunato, and Castellano 2008), and a similar distribution holds across individual researchers, not just articles (Petersen et al. 2011a).&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5">A variety of other evidence is contained in 80,000 Hours&rsquo; career review of </span><span class="c7 c5"><a class="c8" href="https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/academic-research/#academic-research-seems-to-have-been-high-impact-historically">academic research</a></span><span class="c2">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p></div><div><p class="c4"><a href="#ftnt_ref130" id="ftnt130">[130]</a><span class="c5">&nbsp;Anthony J.

Each year the ACU assigns each congressman a score based on his votes on a select number of House bills. This score, which ranges from 0 to 100, measures the extent to which the votes accord with the preferences of the ACU. In Table VII, we explore the effect of protest attendance on this measure of voting behavior.

The estimates indicate that scores in districts with smaller rallies due to rain were less conservative by 1.9 to 2.8 ACU points in 2009 (significant at the 5% and 1% percent level, respectively), when the sample mean equaled 41.25 For comparison, the difference between the average Democrat and the average Republican is about 85, while the standard deviation within the Republican caucus is about 12.5.26 The effect in 2010 is estimated at 3.2-4.3 points (significant at the 1% and 5% percent level), with slightly lower point estimates when taking the difference between 2010 and 2008 scores.&rdquo;</span></p></div><div><p class="c4"><a href="#ftnt_ref167" id="ftnt167">[167]</a><span class="c5">&nbsp;Page </span><span class="c5">27.</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;This supports observational data on 23-4 that &ldquo;moving from a county that was not exposed to nonviolent protest activity to one that was caused an approximately 0.9 percentage point increase in Democratic vote share (p &lt;0.001).

One of the major problems with the crisp-set approach to QCA (as opposed, for example, to the fuzzy-set approach) lies in the loss of information in the dichotomization process. This implies that one can get different results with only slight changes in measurement. We explained why we prefer to stick to crisp-set QCA in this analysis and have justified our measurement choices. However, this is a general problem with QCA which one can hardly avoid. Other limitations of QCA include the issue of case sensitivity, the inclusion of logical remainders, the issue of time frame, and the issue of condition sensitivity. Again, we think we have addressed these issues, at least the most important ones, in order to be as transparent as possible in our analysis.&ldquo;</span></p></div><div><p class="c4"><a href="#ftnt_ref192" id="ftnt192">[192]</a><span class="c5">&nbsp;Felix Kolb, </span><span class="c6 c5">Protest and Opportunities: The Political Outcomes of Social Movements</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;(Frankfurt: Campus Verlag, 2007), 43, citing MacDougall, Minicucci, and Myers (1995) and Soule and King (2006).

On 285, he summarizes how his case studies support this conclusion: &ldquo;My research shows that (at least) the opportunities provided by elite conflict, political crisis, unstable electoral alignments, high issue salience, and public attitudes that helped movements to succeed can be outcomes of previous mobiliation. Using various forms of direct action, the civil rights movement increased the salience of the civil rights issue up to the point where it became the most important problem facing the nation - a problem that could no longer be ignored (see chapter six). The evidence is also strong that civil rights protest contributed to the emergence of racially liberal public attitudes (see chapter seven). In a similar vein, the anti-nuclear energy movement contributed to increasing public opposition to nuclear energy and was responsible for the emerging elite conflict over the issue (see chapter thirteen). In Austria, Germany, and Sweden, anti-nuclear protest even undermined the stable electoral alignments that threatened and displaced the ruling political parties. If a social movement can create opportunities, it should be equally able to (unintentionally) contribute to the creation of political constraints. For example, the process that aligned white Southerners and northern white working-class voters with the Republican Party was set off by the political success of the civil rights movement, and by the spreading urban riots (see chapter six).&rdquo;</span></p></div><div><p class="c4"><a href="#ftnt_ref196" id="ftnt196">[196]</a><span class="c2">&nbsp;Benjamin F.

Nevertheless, it is possible that the interests of those who are included in the original extrapolation base would be accommodated to a greater degree than the interests of outsides. In particular, if the dynamic acts only where there is broad agreement between individual extrapolated volitions (as in Yudkowsky&rsquo;s original proposal), there would seem to be a significant risk of an ungenerous blocking vote that could prevent, for instance, the welfare of nonhuman animals or digital minds rom being protected.
