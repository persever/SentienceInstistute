Educated elites may be exposed to different information sources to the general public, such as broadsheet newspapers rather than tabloid newspapers, which may encourage rifts between the opinions of the public and the educated elite. If different polities engage differently with public opinion, then a similar divergence between elite and public opinion may be translated into substantially different legislation. Various long-term and indirect factors also affect death penalty legislation in US states, reducing the influence of public opinion. In 1936, only one state had public support for the death penalty below 50% (Wisconsin, with 49% support) and in 1990-2, no state had lower than 61% support; nevertheless, 5 and 12 states respectively had no (or very limited) capital punishment laws at those two points in time. Outside of the US, many countries have abolished capital punishment in spite of majority public support for its use and variations in levels of public opinion do little to explain variations in capital punishment between Asian countries.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c8 c12"><span class="c10 c6"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c6">Additionally, Jamie Harris, &ldquo;Social Movement Lessons From the US Anti-Abortion Movement&rdquo; (November 26, 2019), </span><span class="c4 c6"><a class="c1" href="https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/anti-abortion">https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/anti-abortion</a></span><span class="c6">&nbsp;notes that, </span><span class="c10 c6">&ldquo;[p]olitical scientist Rosemary Nossiff compares the states of New York and Pennsylvania to better understand the causes of legislative change in the period 1965-72&hellip; Nossiff highlights several factors as of potential causal importance in securing legislative change in the desired direction, including successful political maneuvering and alignment with influential politicians (the Democratic party in both instances)...
