Those working in advocacy aim to promote change towards their position (e.g., increasing plant-based product consumption, increasing pro-environmental behaviors, increasing support for policies that address systemic inequalities). Governments try to limit the influence of other countries&rsquo; misinformation campaigns within their own country.

Likewise, a study could be either contrived or real-world and have only one of the four influence types. This categorization of articles into one of four possible influence types is loose, building on Courchesne et al.&rsquo;s framework separating traditional and social media.

Misinformation and disinformation might be better considered as sub-types of traditional media and social media since misinformation and disinformation can be passed through traditional and social media.

For example, a study with 100 participants that had contemporary data collection would not qualify as having archival data or big data. A study that tested the effects of WhatsApp messaging in a political campaign to increase votes for a candidate would qualify for three options under &ldquo;study features&rdquo;: examined a mechanism of influence operations, targeted individuals with messages, and tried to actively change individuals&rsquo; behavior. That same study would also qualify as having an &ldquo;influence specific&rdquo; of serving to actively shape power.</span></p><p class="c30"><span class="c10">This coding scheme reflects my judgments as to which categories a study belongs to rather than a purely objective assessment.

The same experiment could be categorized as having a real-world context because it occurred in real-time, in public, and on a real-platform. I categorized this study as real-world rather than contrived because contact with the researchers was limited, the treatment was not isolated from normal Twitter usage, and the treatment did not entail substantially different Twitter usage norms than usual. For situations like this, I categorized based on my judgment of the degree to which the study expressed the relevant features. Some of these choices could have been made differently and additional interpretation should consider the specifics of the study.</span></p><p class="c30"><span class="c0">Table 2 shows the coding scheme, keywords, and number of articles categorized under each feature.

This leaves a large gap in the research on why people can be influenced, how influence operations persist over time, and in what contexts or situations various influence operations are more or less effective, to name a few of many potential mechanisms. A preference for natural experiments or real-world studies may lead to fewer resources spent on mechanistic studies that occur in lab-based or contrived situations. There are some examples of natural experiments in real-world contexts that are also mechanistic studies. </span><span class="c7"><a class="c36" href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2019.07.026">Barfar&rsquo;s (2019)</a></span><span class="c10">, &ldquo;</span><span class="c10">Cognitive and Affective Responses to Political Disinformation on Facebook</span><span class="c0">,&rdquo; found that exposure to fake news produced more anger and incivility than exposure to true news which produced more analytical thinking, positivity, and anxiety.</span></li></ol><ul class="c4 lst-kix_n7bo2rltz3a6-1 start"><li class="c11 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Courchesne et al. highlighted a need for more mechanistic research, particularly on why misinformation is effective and how it persists. </span></li><li class="c46 c42 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Mechanistic studies offer important insights into how influence operations work and they can be conducted with individual-level or institutional-level outcomes. For example, mechanisms for how individuals remember misinformation may be different than mechanisms explaining how the source of misinformation changes social trust. Misinformation might have stronger effects or transfer at a faster rate on social media than traditional media. Insight into the mechanisms enabling influence operations is critical to developing the anti-influence intervention strategies that Courchesne et al. identified as important to policymakers. </span></li></ul><ol class="c4 lst-kix_n7bo2rltz3a6-0" start="4"><li class="c46 c34 li-bullet-0"><span class="c10">The conceptual and methodological distinctions between misinformation and disinformation are unclear.

The research on influence operations uses the terms seemingly interchangeably and this limits the conclusions and strategies that decision makers can take. If misinformation involves more subtle tactics than disinformation, different anti-influence strategies might be developed. If misinformation is more common than disinformation, decision makers might want to focus on combatting misinformation. If disinformation has larger, stronger, or more severe direct effects, decision makers might want to focus resources on combatting disinformation. </span></li><li class="c46 c34 li-bullet-0"><span class="c10">Influence operations may work differently for health outcomes than for other outcomes (e.g., political, social). Why, when, and how these differences occur is understudied.

For example, influence operations were more successful at increasing yearly cancer screening or vaccination behaviors than habitual behaviors like choosing to routinely consume different food, floss daily, or increase daily physical activity. Furthermore, Wakefield et al. identified that repeating the same influence operation had only a small effect on habitual behavior change, consistent with</span><span class="c10"><a class="c36" href="https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/health-behavior">&nbsp;</a></span><span class="c10">some of the implications from </span><span class="c7"><a class="c36" href="https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/health-behavior">Harris&rsquo; (2020)</a></span><span class="c0">&nbsp;review of the research on health behavior change. This reifies that using the same influence repeatedly may reap few rewards for habits like flossing or switching to a plant-based diet.</span></li><li class="c34 c39 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Although Courchesne et al. intended to review interdisciplinary influence operations research, they implicitly took a predominantly international relations perspective. The implications are that influence operations are successful and dangerous, particularly in political and international arenas, and that decision makers need better anti-influence strategies informed by research. </span></li></ol><p class="c39 c63"><span class="c0">Of the 82 articles, 74% were conducted in the real-world rather than in a contrived situation and 48% focused on influence operations that sought to change the balance of political power. Only 7% focused on influence operations intended to do good, meaning that 93% focused on control-oriented, harmful, or destructive outcomes. This could suggest that there are more real-world influence operations with destructive or destabilizing outcomes than real-world influence operations with prosocial or morally expansive outcomes.</span></p><p class="c39 c63"><span class="c10">These numbers could alternatively point to a</span><span class="c10"><a class="c36" href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1207/S15327957PSPR0504_2">&nbsp;</a></span><span class="c7"><a class="c36" href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1207/S15327957PSPR0504_2">negativity bias</a></span><span class="c10">&nbsp;within the extant research on influence operations, where influence operations are framed as threatening, negative, or unwanted influences that need to be combatted. One implication of this is that all social influence may be perceived as harmful; undermining </span><span class="c7"><a class="c36" href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15534510.2011.649890">the idea</a></span><span class="c0">&nbsp;that social influence is an inherent, long-existing element of human societies.

Courchesne et al. acknowledged a robust literature on &ldquo;&lsquo;pro-social&rsquo; influence campaigns&rdquo; in pro-environmental, health, and traditional political advertising. Additionally, a large body of social psychological research exists on strategies to change prejudiced attitudes and discriminatory behaviors. These strategies are not traditionally labeled as &ldquo;influence operations&rdquo; but they are similar to those included in many of the articles reviewed by Courchesne et al.
