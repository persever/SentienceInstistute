For example, a 2017 Sentience Institute </span><span class="c4 c0"><a class="c7" href="https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/british-antislavery">report</a></span><span class="c3 c0">&nbsp;on the 1800s anti-slavery movement found that the consideration anti-slavery activists had for humans transferred to animals, making them some of the first animal rights activists. </span></p><p class="c2 c20 c13"><span class="c3 c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c20"><span class="c0">Given the </span><span class="c4 c0"><a class="c7" href="https://ai100.stanford.edu/2021-report/standing-questions-and-responses/sq2-what-are-most-important-advances-ai">rapid growth</a></span><span class="c0">&nbsp;of AI application and sophistication and an increasing likelihood that the number of future sentient beings will be </span><span class="c4 c0"><a class="c7" href="https://www.overcomingbias.com/p/a-galaxy-on-earthhtml">vast</a></span><span class="c0">, here we analyze whether the spillover of moral consideration is feasible or likely between beings that are granted (at least some) consideration (e.g., humans, animals) and future AIs. In psychology and human-robot interaction (HRI) studies, AIs are often used to improve the moral treatment of humans, suggesting that moral consideration can transfer from AIs to humans. For example, positive emotions from being hugged by a robot </span><span class="c11 c0"><a class="c7" href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8172336/">spilled over</a></span><span class="c0">&nbsp;to increase donations to human-focused charities. Some research suggests that the transfer of moral consideration from humans or nonhuman animals to AIs is also possible. </span><span class="c4 c0"><a class="c7" href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2016-48422-007">A 2016 study</a></span><span class="c0">&nbsp;showed that 5- and 7-year-old children with biological dogs at home treated </span><span class="c4 c0"><a class="c7" href="https://robots.ieee.org/robots/aibo2018/">robot dogs</a></span><span class="c0">&nbsp;better than children without biological dogs. This suggests that moral spillover to AIs might occur </span><span class="c4 c0"><a class="c7" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352250X21001378">incidentally or automatically</a></span><span class="c0">&nbsp;as part of humans&rsquo; </span><span class="c4 c0"><a class="c7" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00822/full">social relationships</a></span><span class="c0">. </span></p><p class="c2 c20 c13"><span class="c3 c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c20"><span class="c0">We do not know whether or not moral consideration will reliably transfer to and across the diverse range of AIs with different appearances, inner features, or mental capacities who are </span><span class="c11 c0"><a class="c7" href="https://longtermrisk.org/risks-of-astronomical-future-suffering/">likely to proliferate</a></span><span class="c0">&nbsp;in the future. There is little evidence on whether or not moral consideration would transfer from very different beings to AIs who display very few or none of the same features. For instance, moral consideration of a biological dog might spill over to moral consideration of a robot dog but it may not spill over to moral consideration of a disembodied large language model like </span><span class="c4 c0"><a class="c7" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI#Generative_models">GPT-n</a></span><span class="c0">. This might be especially significant if arguably superficial features such as appearance, substrate, or purpose override the effects of </span><span class="c4 c0"><a class="c7" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s43681-023-00260-1">features that grant moral standing</a></span><span class="c3 c0">&nbsp;(e.g., sentience). For example, a sentient disembodied algorithm or a sentient cell-like robot, who could theoretically benefit from the transfer of moral consideration based on their sentience, might not. </span></p><p class="c2 c20 c13"><span class="c3 c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c20"><span class="c3 c0">This post reviews research on moral spillover in the context of AIs and examines factors that might influence its occurrence. We suggest that spillover might foster the moral consideration of AIs and call for more research to investigate spillover effects on a range of current and future AIs.</span></p><h1 class="c16" id="h.8ub9rsi830s"><span class="c3 c33">Types of spillover</span></h1><p class="c2 c20"><span class="c0">In economics, </span><span class="c11 c0"><a class="c7" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spillover_(economics)">spillovers</a></span><span class="c0">, also known as externalities, are a natural part of structural theories in which a transaction affects non-participants, such as if an event in an economy affects another&mdash;usually more dependent&mdash;economy.

Research on possible interventions with larger samples, for the purpose of studying moral spillover, and to track long-term effects (e.g., how moral consideration might transfer from current AIs to future AIs), would provide more insight into how spillover effects might facilitate or hinder the inclusion of AIs in the moral circle. </span></p><h1 class="c20 c47" id="h.jxrvu05vmabb"><span class="c3 c33">What future research is needed?</span></h1><p class="c2 c20"><span class="c0">Research on moral spillover towards AIs is in its infancy.

Developing this research in the moral domain with studies that examine precursors (e.g., pre-existing negative attitudes) to spillover could help us understand positive and negative attitude transfer and the potential backfiring effects of spillover interventions. This matters because interaction with AIs is likely to increase as they become more widespread in society. If</span><span class="c17">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c0">positive interactions with existing AIs facilitate moral consideration for AIs in general, future AIs might have a better chance of being included in the moral circle.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c3 c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c20"><span class="c3 c0">How future AIs will appear, think, feel, and behave is uncertain. They are likely to have diverse mental capacities, goals, and appearances. Future AIs could range from highly human-like robots to non-embodied sentient algorithms or minuscule cell-like AIs. The mental capacities of AIs are likely to vary on a spectrum (e.g., from minimally sentient to more sentient than humans). How these diverse future AIs will be affected by moral spillover is unknown. Future research could examine whether there is a minimal threshold of similarity with humans that AIs must meet for moral consideration to transfer. Future studies could also examine whether the inclusion of even one kind of AI in the moral circle spills over to all AIs regardless of their features. </span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c3 c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c20"><span class="c3 c0">Furthermore, a neglected but important research direction is the examination of temporal spillover. A change in how AIs are treated in the present might shape the moral consideration of AIs in the future. One possible way of investigating temporal spillover would be to use longitudinal studies to examine how present attitudes and behaviors towards AIs affect attitudes and behaviors towards different future AIs. Further research on the effectiveness of interventions that change core beliefs towards AIs is likely also an important part of understanding temporal moral spillover. </span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c3 c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c20"><span class="c0">Expanding the research on moral spillover in the context of AIs has the potential to identify boundaries that shape human-AI interaction and the moral consideration of present AIs.
