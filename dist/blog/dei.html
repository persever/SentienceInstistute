I have generally excluded recommendations based on individual lab studies or heavily qualified their conclusions.

The available research is thinner and more reliant on correlational data than one might expect given that the diversity training industry alone is worth </span><span class="c2"><a class="c3" href="https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/gender-equality/focusing-on-what-works-for-workplace-diversity">$8 billion</a></span><span>&nbsp;and more than </span><span class="c2"><a class="c3" href="https://www.diversitybestpractices.com/sites/diversitybestpractices.com/files/attachments/2017/07/fortune_500_1000_commitment_0.pdf">half</a></span><span class="c1">&nbsp;the Fortune 500s have diversity programs or officers, but there is sufficient evidence to provide useful guidance to organizations and communities seeking to be equitable and inclusive.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c15"><span>The general takeaway from this research is that organizations will be more effective in efforts to achieve equity if they focus more on implementing </span><span class="c21">inclusionary practices</span><span>&nbsp;that limit the influence of attitudinal prejudice on behavior than on efforts to directly reduce attitudinal prejudice.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c15"><span>While diversity is well-defined &mdash; and in this post, I&rsquo;ll mostly discuss demographic diversity &mdash; t</span><span>here is no consensus in academia or business on precise definitions of equity or inclusion, so I will attempt to lay out definitions that I find both useful and common. </span><span>&ldquo;Inclusion&rdquo; generally has </span><span>two</span><span>&nbsp;meaning</span><span>s</span><span>. It describe</span><span>s</span><span>&nbsp;the </span><span class="c21">feeling of being included</span><span>, </span><span>i.e.</span><span>&nbsp;being welcomed and treated equitably. Note that this is somewhat distinct from the fact of the matter as to whether a person is being treated equitably, as there can be ambiguity. Inclusion </span><span>or &ldquo;inclusionary practice&rdquo; </span><span>also describes </span><span class="c21">practices that help us to be equitable</span><span>, such as heuristics of transparen</span><span>cy in</span><span>&nbsp;decisions where there may be ambiguity about their equitableness, or having an accountability system in place so that any decisions that are made inequitably can be rectified.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c15"><span>Inclusion&rsquo;s</span><span>&nbsp;goal of </span><span class="c21">equity</span><span>&nbsp;is distinct from a goal of equality. Equity is about equality of </span><span>opportunity, which is not always synonymous with equality of treatment or outcome</span><span>. Some people have more barriers in the way of their success than others, some of which others have set in place and some of which we ourselves do, and equity is about removing those barriers to even the playing field. Equity is instrumentally important in the same way that being fair and unbiased (which are essentially synonymous with equity) are important: </span><span>Equity</span><span>&nbsp;empowers individuals to reach their full potential, and enables teams to benefit from full talent pools.</span><span>&nbsp;Nondiscrimination, a significant part of ensuring equity, is also a right held by all humans under the United Nations&rsquo;

In other words, while we can say that diversity &mdash; particularly the better-studied </span><span>cases</span><span>&nbsp;of gender and racial or ethnic diversity &mdash; is correlated to company performance, it&rsquo;s not clear whether merely increasing diversity &mdash; in terms of the demographics of a team &mdash; will cause increased performance. </span><span>Publication bias may also limit this evidence if we expect reports showing negative correlations between diversity and performance to be harder to publish.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c15"><span>T</span><span>here is </span><span>some </span><span class="c2"><a class="c3" href="https://doi.org/10.1177/1548051813504460">evidence</a></span><span>&nbsp;that gender diversity does predict revenue independent of employee engagement, a</span><span>nd</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c2"><a class="c3" href="https://hbr.org/2018/07/the-other-diversity-dividend">evidence</a></span><span>&nbsp;that hiring more women improves the performance of venture capital firms.

And since it seems likely that people from marginalized groups face more day-to-day obstacles, time costs, and stress than those of more privileged groups at the same apparent performance levels, which presumably prevents them from performing as well as they would in a fully equitable world, it&rsquo;s also possible that the benefits of diversity will increase as communities become more equitable.

It&rsquo;s important that we create a community that is sustainable and healthy, and it seems to me that we will better achieve that through restorative justice than retributive justice.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c15"><span>&ldquo;No tolerance&rdquo; is an important policy for preventing and responding to misconduct, in the sense that every issue will be addressed. But no tolerance doesn&rsquo;t require a &ldquo;heavy handed&rdquo; approach &mdash; to the contrary, I think it&rsquo;s critical for the heaviness of our responses to be commensurate with the severity of an action and to escalate progressively with failures to participate in restorative processes. Small transgressions, for instance, should be &ldquo;called in&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt17" id="ftnt_ref17">[17]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;so the person who made the apparent mistake has the opportunity to defend themselves if necessary, or to rectify their mistake and improve. If someone has committed a transgression, we want them to seek understanding, and if they do come to understand, apologize, and demonstrate a credible intention to improve, they should be given the chance to carry forward as a better community member, if possible depending on the severity of their action. To create a culture in which they are incentivized to cooperate like that, any negative consequences resulting from their admission of guilt and cooperation in restoration have to be much less severe and much less likely than the consequences of refusing to cooperate. Otherwise people will have incentive to instead aggressively defend themselves against accusations, which is a lost opportunity for both the healing of the person who was wronged and the betterment of the person in the wrong, and which may result in the disempowerment of everyone involved in ensuing drama.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c15"><span>Of course, restorative justice requires the participation of the accused, and in some cases, when private restoration has been attempted but is failing, it may be necessary to e</span><span>scalate to punishment, &ldquo;calling out,&rdquo; or a period of exclusion</span><span class="c1">.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c15"><span>But restorative justice often succeeds, in my own experience and that of others, and it&rsquo;s what we all want for ourselves when we make mistakes. Because of my own efforts in restorative justice, several people who may have lasting influence in my communities are now more capable allies than they would have been if I had behaved retributively in response to their poor behavior towards me. Instead, they made efforts to understand, make amends, and improve. Private efforts in restoration can take great patience and compassion on the part of the wronged, and that may feel unfair, but the only way we change people is by giving them the opportunity to grow away from the harmful misunderstandings and behaviors that a prejudiced society has taught them, just as we give that opportunity to everyone who used to eat animals or engage in other speciesist and harmful behavior towards nonhumans but pulled their way out of that enculturation &mdash; including almost every one of us as farmed animal advocates.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c16 c17"></span></p><p class="c15"><span>Restoration takes a lot more fortitude and effort in the short run than retribution, but when both the accuser and accused participate it seems to ultimately result in a lot less fighting, stress, time, and harm on all sides, and helps us build a strong and healthy community where people are encouraged to come together and grow rather than a weak and unstable one where we divide and stagnate.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>So I hope we have the fortitude to work hard for restoration and positive-sum outcomes, even when we&rsquo;re wounded and rightly frustrated. And I hope we have the courage to accept when our efforts are failing and there will not be a cooperative, healthy resolution, and the resolve to push forward to the least bad outcomes when we fail to reach good ones.</span></p><h2 class="c13" id="h.uf4zqchv1mdr"><span class="c4 c11">Developments this year</span></h2><p class="c15"><span>This year, the animal advocacy movement took up the #metoo movement and made notable progress on sexual harassment.

This seems particularly relevant in the nonprofit sphere which relies so heavily on voluntary labor. In activist spaces, that voluntary labor may also be significantly comprised of emotional labor for the community and as such may come with a higher stress burden than paid hours.</span></p></div><div><p class="c9"><a href="#ftnt_ref15" id="ftnt15">[15]</a><span class="c0">&nbsp;This may be because they activate stereotypes, make prejudiced behavior appear normal, or make the viewer feel </span><span class="c2 c0"><a class="c3" href="https://rework.withgoogle.com/guides/unbiasing-raise-awareness/steps/learn-about-Googles-workshop-experiment/">&rdquo;woke&rdquo;</a></span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;for seeing the training or believe that their organization is for showing it, which could enable the viewer to adopt a moral license or relax their care with their behavior.</span></p></div><div><p class="c9"><a href="#ftnt_ref16" id="ftnt16">[16]</a><span class="c0">&nbsp;Implicit prejudice is poorly studied, and popular measurements such as Implicit Awareness Tests (IATs) are poor predictors of behavior.
