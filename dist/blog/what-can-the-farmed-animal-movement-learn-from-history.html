This post reflects on four historical case studies which are analyzed in greater depth in a previous post on </span><span class="c6 c10"><a class="c8" href="https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/blog/how-tractable-is-changing-the-course-of-history">How tractable is changing the course of history?</a></span><span>&nbsp;In each of the case studies </span><span>considered</span><span>, historians have been unable to reach consensus on the presence or absence of certain factors, and struggled even more to agree about the relative importance of these factors in causing particular outcomes. These disagreements, as well as the inherent difficulty in forming accurate judgements about causation suggested by hindsight bias and chaos theory, suggest that we should not place too much weight on hypothesized historical cause and effect relationships in general. We can of course be more or less confident in</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c5">hypotheses about causation in specific case studies and rigorous use of counterfactual analyses may lead to firmer conclusions. Given that the conclusions we form from history about causal relationships will always be quite uncertain, this should reduce the weight that we place on the strategic knowledge gained from any individual historical case study. Historical evidence from individual case studies might still be useful in providing inspiration for potential advocacy actions and building intuitions, however.</span></p><p class="c3 c11"><span class="c4 c5"></span></p><p class="c3"><span>Correlations that occur more than once in a similar form across historical contexts and movements&mdash;such as when certain tactics seem successful across multiple movements&mdash;provide much stronger evidence in support of hypothesized cause and effect relationships.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt9" id="ftnt_ref9">[9]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;The larger the dataset, the more confidence we should place in significant findings. Studies such as William Gamson&rsquo;s Strategy of Social Protest</span><sup><a href="#ftnt10" id="ftnt_ref10">[10]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;can show us which internal characteristics of social movement organizations (SMOs) seem to increase the likelihood of successful outcomes, even if causation cannot be proven. Quantitative and comparative studies of the importance of factors external to SMOs can also increase our confidence in conclusions about the importance of broad factors in causing social change, at least for specific historical movements. They can also increase our confidence in conclusions about the causes of social change across contexts (</span><span>see &ldquo;</span><span class="c6"><a class="c8" href="https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/blog/how-tractable-is-changing-the-course-of-history#external-constraints-on-the-impact-of-social-movements">External constraints on the impact of social movements</a></span><span>&rdquo; in &ldquo;</span><span class="c6"><a class="c8" href="https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/blog/how-tractable-is-changing-the-course-of-history">How tractable is changing the course of history?</a></span><span>&rdquo;</span><span class="c4 c5">), although empirical evidence from sociologists suggesting that such generalized theories of causation do not necessarily hold consistently should reduce the weight that we place on such studies.</span></p><h2 class="c12" id="h.kj71imjf7cwv"><span>View updates</span></h2><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c5">Given the varying intuitions and existing views of people on the topic of historical tractability, we can&rsquo;t present conclusions from this work that would apply to all readers, so this section instead specifically details how Jamie Harris (author) and Jacy Reese (editor) changed their views during the course of this project.</span></p><p class="c3 c11"><span class="c4 c5"></span></p><p class="c3"><span>Sentience Institute staff had slightly different intuitions about the questions, &ldquo;</span><span>To what extent </span><span>can we actually glean significant strategic knowledge from history?&rdquo; and, &ldquo;How much weight should the EAA community place on insights from history?&rdquo; My views about these key questions did not change significantly over the course of my research into them, although my views about smaller issues within these key questions did.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3 c11"><span class="c4 c5"></span></p><p class="c3"><span>I will now place significantly less weight on knowledge from most individual, historical case studies</span><span>&nbsp;after becoming aware of theoretical arguments and psychological evidence that I had been unaware of. My previous intuition (that there was usually sufficient evidence contained within historians&#39; narratives to mostly justify their seemingly confident views about causal relationships in particular historical case studies) was challenged by reanalyzing the narratives of historians in light of the</span><span>&nbsp;theoretical arguments and psychological evidence.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>In contrast, I will now place more weight on knowledge from comparative analyses across countries, states, or movements. This is because after reflecting on the strengths and weaknesses of the different types of evidence available, I became more confident that </span><span>w</span><span>hen correlations </span><span>between movement tactics and outcomes </span><span>are replicated across multiple social movements they will replicate to the context of the farmed animal movement.</span><span>&nbsp;I was also impressed by some of the quantitative and comparative methods used by sociologists that I was previously unaware of, as well as the potential for </span><span>counterfactual analysis</span><span class="c4 c5">&nbsp;in history, to provide stronger evidence on historical causation.</span></p><p class="c3 c11"><span class="c4 c5"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c5">This suggests that where trade-offs arise in our use of time, SI and other organizations using historical evidence should prioritize analyzing where correlations occur across multiple movements over trying to reach firmer conclusions about causation in individual movements.</span></p><p class="c3 c11"><span class="c4 c5"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c5">Jacy Reese, our Research Director who edited this article, did not discernibly change his views on the two key questions we discussed beforehand: how easily we can glean strategic knowledge from history research and how much weight historical knowledge should be given compared to other research results (e.g. RCTs). However, Jacy did change his views on historical tractability based on the first of these posts, &ldquo;How tractable is it for thoughtful actors to change the course of history?&rdquo; He says this was because the first post had more empirical research results and more discussion of scholarly opinion where Jacy was uncertain about the extent of agreement.</span></p><p class="c3 c11"><span class="c4 c5"></span></p><p class="c3"><span>See </span><span class="c6"><a class="c8" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15cDDnVYdQTTyWIco-txknf1Pus6lfG-u3kUT2Do8GRE/edit?usp%3Dsharing">this spreadsheet</a></span><span>&nbsp;for quantitative versions of these views, before and after this research project.</span></p><h1 class="c17" id="h.nc45z6twe3qs"><span class="c4 c21">How confident can we be in judgements about historical causation?</span></h1><p class="c3"><span>One factor </span><span>that</span><span>&nbsp;should </span><span>change</span><span>&nbsp;the weight that we place on strategic knowledge from history is the amount of confidence that we have in our hypotheses about causal relationships in any individual case study. For example, looking at the American civil rights movement, we might hypothesize that the March on Washington</span><span>&nbsp;in</span><span>&nbsp;August 1963 was crucial in driving through the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964</span><span>. If </span><span>this hypothesis is correct</span><span>, it suggests</span><span>&nbsp;that peaceful mass demonstrations are an effective way </span><span>to encourage</span><span>&nbsp;beneficial legislation. But if we are unsure whether the march itself, </span><span>other contextual factors, </span><span>other peaceful </span><span>demonstrations</span><span>, or more violent </span><span>resistance</span><span>&nbsp;were more important in causing the passage of the Act, then </span><span>this is a less robust strategic implication</span><span>.</span></p><h2 class="c12" id="h.jf4kna8x42oc"><span class="c4 c7">Views of philosophers </span></h2><p class="c3"><span>E.

Somerset tried to escape but was captured and returned to his owner; as property, he could not sue for his release. In 1772 the English abolitionist Granville Sharp, serving as a legal proxy, filed a writ of habeas corpus in his stead, which the justice, Lord Mansfield, upheld against the commercial interests of slaveholders.

I am convinced that causal complexity is an important part of the answer (cf. Earl 2000; Giugni 1999). In the context of social movement outcomes, causal complexity refers to the fact that not only social movements but also interest groups, public opinion, mass media, political parties and many other factors are likely to exert causal influence on the process of social and political change. In order to sort out the various influences, we first need clear theories of the causal processes by which social movements produce their effects (Tilly, 1999).

On page 113, on the ecology movement in the USA, for example, Giugni notes that &ldquo;Spending by the U.S. government for environmental protection seems to have followed a development opposed to that of protest, in particular with a strong decline during the early 1980s. This might lead us to conclude that the ecology movement was instrumental in bringing about changes in environmental policy, at least as far as spending is concerned; yet, the reverse causal path is just as likely. Changes in environmental spending might have provoked a decline of the mobilization. Furthermore, both developments over time largely reflect shifts in the presidency. Protest went up when a Republican president was in power and down with a Democrat in the White House. Similarly, spending increased under Democratic presidencies and diminished under Republican ones.&rdquo;</span></p></div><div><p class="c2"><a href="#ftnt_ref22" id="ftnt22">[22]</a><span class="c0">&nbsp;S.

As a brief summary, &ldquo;positivist&rdquo; historians have seen history as a science, drawing clear-cut conclusions from historical evidence, &ldquo;idealists&rdquo; stress the importance of intuition and interpretation. Postmodernists see both historical evidence and the language of historical writing as subjective and full of assumptions. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Alun Munslow, </span><span class="c0 c10">The New History</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;(Abingdon and New York: Routledge, 2014; first published 2008), 8.3, for example, notes &ldquo;working from the belief that historians ascribe meanings to the past rather than discover its inherent or given meaning, my basic pre-supposition is that the positioned historians through his/her historicised (ideologised, gendered, class-based or whatever) situation, constitutes the meaning of the past as he/she narrates it. In other words, the historical consciousness is as much tropical or narrative-linguistic as it is a synthetic empirical-analytical undertaking. This is the perspective, founded on the work of key philosophical, literary and historical thinkers like Stephen C. Pepper, Paul Rocoeur, Heyden White, and Frank Ankersmit that informs my view of history.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ernst Breisach, </span><span class="c0 c10">On the Future of History: The Postmodernist Challenge and its Aftermath </span><span class="c4 c0">(Chicago and London: The University of Chicago Press, 2003), 24, summarising the influence of the Linguistic Turn on postmodernist thought, notes that &ldquo;in the linguistically constructed world, truth would have neither permanence nor stable foundations and hence no privileged authority.

This recognition has been the most important contribution of narrativism to historical inquiry. For some time to come, narrative and language will not be regarded as silent and passive partners in the creation of historical works. But as a theory of history meant to replace traditional history with its full recognition of the dimension of time and of elements that in human terms are stable and can be grasped cognitively, poststructuralist narrativism has not yet commended itself ot historians&rdquo;; 116 adds that &ldquo;The rejection of demands for radical change in historical inquiry came from historians, however much they differed in their views, foci and arguments. They agreed on the destructive effect of the denial of a possible, referential, authoritative truth and of the theoretical tenets derived from it. Historians also protested that, contrary to postmodernist contentions, they have never claimed to have attained the final truth about the past but only that sucha &nbsp;truth must remain the ultimate although probably never attainable ideal. Good historians always have been aware of the fallibility of their findings - due to error, insufficient data, risks taken in interpretation, and the experiential background of the historians. They have affirmed, however, that the cumulative results of proper perception, cognition, and imagination, expressed in the symbolic forms of language, could lead to a sufficiently proximate knowledge of the past as it had once been lived.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Richard J.

But&hellip; for my own part, I remain optimistic that objective historical knowledge is both desirable and attainable&hellip; I will look humbly at the past and say despite them all: it really happened, and we really can, if we are very scrupulous and careful and self-critical, find out how it happened and reach some tenable though always less than final conclusions about what it all meant.&rdquo;</span></p></div><div><p class="c2"><a href="#ftnt_ref61" id="ftnt61">[61]</a><span class="c0">&nbsp;Alun Munslow, </span><span class="c0 c10">The New History</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;(Abingdon and New York: Routledge, 2014; first published 2008), 8.8, 8.32</span></p></div><div><p class="c2"><a href="#ftnt_ref62" id="ftnt62">[62]</a><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;E.
