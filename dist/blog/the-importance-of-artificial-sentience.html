Doctors replace the damaged neurons in your brain with computer chips that are functionally identical to healthy neurons. After your first treatment that replaces just a few thousand neurons, you feel no different. As your condition deteriorates, the treatments proceed and, eventually, the final biological neuron in your brain is replaced. </span><span>Still, you feel, think, and act exactly as you did before. </span><span>It seems that y</span><span>ou are</span><span>&nbsp;as </span><span class="c8"><a class="c2" href="https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/blog/what-is-sentience">sentient</a></span><span>&nbsp;as you were before.
