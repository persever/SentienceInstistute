Its advocates support, at least in part, an expansion of the moral circle to encompass unborn human fetuses. Although there are important differences between the US anti-abortion and farmed animal protection movements, there is a fundamental similarity between them: Advocates from both movements believe the entities they seek to protect are granted insufficient consideration, protection, or rights and that it is worth investing time and resources into securing more consideration, protection, or rights for them. Other features that affect the anti-abortion movement&rsquo;s comparability with the farmed animal movement are listed </span><span class="c7"><a class="c14" href="#h.1y810tw">below</a></span><span>, but overall it seems we can glean some strategic insight from the anti-abortion movement suitable for effective animal advocacy&mdash;that is, information that can be used to understand how to maximize the impact of interventions used.</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt1" id="ftnt_ref1">[1]</a></sup></p><p class="c9 c13"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c1">Importantly, this report makes no attempt to evaluate the goals of either movement. This report is exclusively about the strategy of social movements, and while we will discuss goals insofar as they are relevant to strategic discussion, we deliberately avoid any moral assessment.</span></p><p class="c9 c13"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c1">US farmed animal advocates tend to favor less restrictive abortion regulations, so we know that some might be hesitant to take seriously a report that looks for insight in the strategy of the anti-abortion movement. We think this is actually a strong reason to study this movement, because it is so different and therefore might have unusually interesting lessons to be gleaned. We hope readers will keep an open mind and attempt to examine the strategy of this movement, and other social movements, with an objective lens.</span></p><p class="c9 c13"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c1">This report provides a condensed history of the US anti-abortion movement, from the 1960s to the present. After providing this history, the report draws tentative conclusions about which strategies seemed to be most effective for the anti-abortion movement and suggests potential implications for the farmed animal movement&rsquo;s strategy. The focus of this report is on strategic insights for the farmed animal movement, but some insights may be useful for other movements as well.</span></p><p class="c9 c13"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c1">This report focuses on the US anti-abortion movement, rather than international efforts, for three reasons:</span></p><p class="c9 c13"><span class="c1"></span></p><ol class="c18 lst-kix_list_1-0 start" start="1"><li class="c9 c10"><span class="c1">It seems that abortion issues have been highly salient in US politics and society since the late 1960s, and especially since around 1980, compared to other countries. This suggests that both the anti-abortion movement and abortion rights movements would both have been larger in the US than in other countries that could have been studied and that there would be more content worth evaluating.</span></li><li class="c9 c10"><span>Much activity and research of the effective animal advocacy community has focused on the US.</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt2" id="ftnt_ref2">[2]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;This concentration of resources is at least partially justified by the strategic importance of the US as a country with a large number of animals in factory farmed conditions and substantial social, political, and economic influence over the rest of the world. Given the research gaps in our understanding of effective animal advocacy in the US,</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt3" id="ftnt_ref3">[3]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;it also seems reasonable to focus on coming to stronger conclusions for the optimal movement strategy in that context, before seeking to test whether those conclusions hold in other contexts.</span></li><li class="c9 c10"><span class="c1">After initial research on the topic, it became clear that there was a plethora of surveys, social scientific research, and historical research on the topic of abortion in the US. Limiting the breadth of content to the US only reduced the resources required to complete this report, hopefully without a correspondingly large loss to the completeness and usefulness of the report.</span></li></ol><p class="c9 c13"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c9"><span>This report was mainly undertaken as exploratory analysis, rather than being designed to test explicit hypotheses on strategic effectiveness, though the author initially suspected that the report would provide strategic insight into the question of whether a left-wing or nonpartisan focus is more desirable for the farmed animal movement, as well as other foundational questions in effective animal advocacy.</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt4" id="ftnt_ref4">[4]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;The author also believed that the anti-abortion movement had mostly failed at achieving its goals, and therefore the report would provide evidence that, on average, the tactics used by the anti-abortion movement should be avoided by the farmed animal movement. This is unlike most EAA case studies,</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt5" id="ftnt_ref5">[5]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;in which researchers have analyzed successful movements and therefore tend to take their use of a tactic as evidence of its effectiveness.</span></p><p class="c9 c13"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c9"><span>As with Sentience Institute&rsquo;s report on the British antislavery movement, </span><span class="c6">the farmed animal movement as this report describes it is weighted towards the US movement, so readers from other regions may see different similarities and differences between the US anti-abortion movement and their own region and movement, and should adjust the applicability of this report&rsquo;s conclusions to their own region&rsquo;s advocacy accordingly. This report assumes the reader has some knowledge of modern animal farming and animal advocacy.</span><sup class="c6 c0"><a href="#ftnt6" id="ftnt_ref6">[6]</a></sup></p><p class="c9 c13"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c9"><span>The anti-abortion movement is called a variety of names, including &ldquo;pro-life,&rdquo; &ldquo;right to life,&rdquo; and &ldquo;anti-choice.&rdquo; In comparison, the abortion rights movement is called &ldquo;pro-choice,&rdquo; &ldquo;pro-abortion,&rdquo; or &ldquo;pro-death.&rdquo;</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt7" id="ftnt_ref7">[7]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;In this report, the terms &ldquo;anti-abortion&rdquo; and &ldquo;abortion rights&rdquo; are used respectively for consistency. These terms are used to refer to the US movements specifically, rather than international movements. Given the US context, the term &ldquo;liberal&rdquo; when referring to abortion laws or attitudes implies greater support for abortion rights. What this report refers to as &ldquo;crisis pregnancy centers&rdquo; have been called a variety of names, including &ldquo;Birthright and Emergency Pregnancy Services (EPS),&rdquo; &ldquo;Problem Pregnancy Centers (PPCs),&rdquo; &ldquo;Pregnancy Resource Centers (PRCs),&rdquo; &ldquo;A Woman&#39;s Concern Health Centers,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Life Choices Medical Clinics.&rdquo;</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt8" id="ftnt_ref8">[8]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;Although the term is avoided here due to its imprecision, other authors sometimes use the term &ldquo;therapeutic abortions,&rdquo; which refers to abortions performed to protect the health (sometimes including mental health) or life of the mother. Abortions performed for other reasons are sometimes referred to as &ldquo;elective abortions.&rdquo;</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt9" id="ftnt_ref9">[9]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;The term &ldquo;fetus&rdquo; is used throughout this report.</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt10" id="ftnt_ref10">[10]</a></sup></p><p class="c9 c13"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c9"><span>Finally, this report borrows much of the methodology and framing of Sentience Institute&rsquo;s 2017 report on the British antislavery movement.</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt11" id="ftnt_ref11">[11]</a></sup></p><h2 class="c17" id="h.3znysh7"><span class="c4 c12">Summary of Key Implications</span></h2><p class="c9"><span>A single historical case study does not provide strong evidence for any particular claim; the value of these case studies comes from providing insight into a large number of important questions.</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt12" id="ftnt_ref12">[12]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;This section lists a number of strategic claims supported by the evidence in this report:</span></p><p class="c9 c13"><span class="c1"></span></p><ul class="c18 lst-kix_list_2-0 start"><li class="c9 c10"><span class="c1">Political parties are more willing than expected to modify their stance on controversial issues, even in a direction that seems contrary to the views of their existing supporter base.</span></li><li class="c9 c10"><span class="c1">Even if the theology of a particular religion has unclear implications for the moral issues of interest to social movements, a strong moral stance can still become normalized within a religious community that is highly influential in society at large.</span></li><li class="c9 c10"><span class="c1">Disruptive and confrontational tactics seem likely to be effective at reducing the supply of targeted products or services, but direct effects on demand are smaller. They may also increase issue salience among policymakers and the public. Activists using such tactics should strive to minimize possible negative effects, such as legal restrictions and damage to the credibility and reputation of the movement. Violent tactics seem generally unproductive but some disruptive tactics could be worth the associated risks as measured by activist goals.</span></li><li class="c9 c10"><span class="c1">Legislation that restricts access to abortions seems to have successfully reduced the number of abortions. Though the effect may be small, it is possible that it would be higher on products or services for which the demand is more elastic, such as animal products. This legislation does not seem to have substantially reduced the public&#39;s support for further incremental legislation.</span></li><li class="c9 c10"><span class="c1">For securing desired legislative outcomes at both the state and national levels, securing the support of politicians seems more important than favorable public opinion. A favorable legal environment (e.g. supportive judges) also seems important.</span></li><li class="c9 c10"><span class="c1">Expending substantial resources on encouraging legal change without popular support for the proposed measures seems inadvisable. Highly salient legal changes may provide momentum to opposition groups. Legal rulings seem to have little, if any, positive effect on public opinion regarding controversial issues, though they may consolidate support for issues that were already widely accepted.

Most importantly, the trends in the levels of violent activity spikes do not seem related to measures of political salience or popular perception of the importance of the topic, which may be critical to long-term, substantial change.</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt459" id="ftnt_ref459">[459]</a></sup></p><p class="c9 c13"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c1">Even if this provides evidence that disruptive and violent tactics have had some impact on the supply of abortion services, there is some reason to think that they may have been counterproductive in other ways: </span></p><ul class="c18 lst-kix_list_11-0 start"><li class="c9 c10"><span>The anti-abortion movement seems to have gained a worse (and arguably, more distorted) reputation than the abortion rights movement has,</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt460" id="ftnt_ref460">[460]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;which may be partially due to its use of disruptive and violent tactics.</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt461" id="ftnt_ref461">[461]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;Gallup polls show that there was an increase in the percentage of people identifying as pro-life from 33% in 1995 to 44% in 1997; anti-abortion violence was declining during this period, though it remained high for several years, and the relevant question in the Gallup polls was first asked in 1995, so it is hard to assess whether the change in identity is closely correlated with the decline in violence, which seems to have begun some time in 1992-4.</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt462" id="ftnt_ref462">[462]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;Research for this case study did not reveal other relevant factors that seem likely to have influenced this trend,</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt463" id="ftnt_ref463">[463]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;but longer-term changes in amounts of violence don&rsquo;t correlate very closely with Gallup poll results for public support or opposition to the legality of abortion.</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt464" id="ftnt_ref464">[464]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;The steep rise in the use of hate mail, harassment, trespassing, and picketing conducted by anti-abortion activists in 2015-18 does not seem to have had any notable effect on public opinion, nor do the temporary rises in reports of anthrax and other bioterrorism threats in 2001 or of trespassing in 2005.</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt465" id="ftnt_ref465">[465]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;In contrast, one paper found evidence that &ldquo;each pro-life public activity&rdquo; reported in the </span><span class="c6">New York Times</span><span>&nbsp;during the period 1985-9 &ldquo;produces more than a one-percent backlash&rdquo; against public support for anti-abortion goals, measured through support for maintaining abortion law as it was at the time.</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt466" id="ftnt_ref466">[466]</a></sup></li><li class="c9 c10"><span>Such tactics seem likely to have alienated political and governmental decision-makers.</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt467" id="ftnt_ref467">[467]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;Insofar as social movements seek to make political and institutional changes, alienating decision-makers could be costly. However, theoretically it is possible that decision-makers&rsquo; disapproval remains focused on the worst offending groups and that a radical flank effect will cause greater engagement with less disruptive groups. </span></li><li class="c9 c10"><span>Disruptive tactics, even if not inherently violent, may be linked together with violent tactics in terms of public perception and issue framing when movements endorse both simultaneously. Though this association may, at times, enhance the coercive power of disruptive tactics, it may also cause difficulties for the movement by encouraging restrictive legislation or negatively affecting perceptions of the movement.</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt468" id="ftnt_ref468">[468]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;Similarly, advocates using non-disruptive tactics may be linked together with those using disruptive tactics.</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt469" id="ftnt_ref469">[469]</a></sup></li><li class="c9 c10"><span>Both the Supreme Court and Congress clamped down on these activities in 1994, which led to a decrease in the feasibility and regularity of the use of these tactics.</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt470" id="ftnt_ref470">[470]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;Local courts also acted to restrict direct action protests.</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt471" id="ftnt_ref471">[471]</a></sup></li><li class="c9 c10"><span>Abortion rights activists developed counter-tactics that diminished the effectiveness of disruptive tactics, such as clinic escort services and legal challenges.</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt472" id="ftnt_ref472">[472]</a></sup></li><li class="c9 c10"><span>Direct action tactics and their accompanying rhetoric may be attractive to some advocates and may have movement building benefits, bringing in new activists and other resources, at least temporarily.</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt473" id="ftnt_ref473">[473]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;However, transgressions of the law led to financial costs,</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt474" id="ftnt_ref474">[474]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;as well as emotional and practical difficulties for activists, presumably accelerating activist burnout. For example, anthropologist Carol J. C. Maxwell notes that in the St. Louis direct action community, when four activists were arrested and sentenced to between 225 to 314 days in jail each, &ldquo;[t]hese long sentences were the first issued for anti-abortion sit-ins in St. Louis, and they shocked the activists.

This suggests that such tactics should be used sparingly and timed carefully. For instance, they could be used to support a specific radical institutional demand, following a national scandal or other form of triggering event.</span></p><p class="c9 c13"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c9"><span>&bull; </span><span class="c16">There is indirect evidence that proactive, often confrontational, face-to-face &ldquo;counseling&rdquo; outreach causes a backfire effect, making individuals less supportive of a movement&rsquo;s goals.</span></p><p class="c9 c13"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c9"><span>&ldquo;Sidewalk counseling&rdquo; is where anti-abortion activists stand outside abortion clinics and attempt to dissuade pregnant women from entering the clinic or choosing to have an abortion.</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt478" id="ftnt_ref478">[478]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;Given its disruptive and often confrontational nature (that is, by challenging a pregnant woman&rsquo;s decision to have an abortion and by disrupting the access and operation of the clinics), sidewalk counseling is sometimes considered as comparable to other forms of direct action and confrontational tactics used by the anti-abortion movement.</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt479" id="ftnt_ref479">[479]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;However, sidewalk counseling differs from these other intervention types in that it is targeted primarily at the pregnant woman, rather than the abortion providers.</span></p><p class="c9 c13"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c9"><span>In her book </span><span class="c6">Opposition ">.</span></p></div></body></html>
