Its advocates support, at least in part, an expansion of the moral circle to encompass unborn human fetuses. Although there are important differences between the US anti-abortion and farmed animal protection movements, there is a fundamental similarity between them: Advocates from both movements believe the entities they seek to protect are granted insufficient consideration, protection, or rights and that it is worth investing time and resources into securing more consideration, protection, or rights for them. Other features that affect the anti-abortion movement&rsquo;s comparability with the farmed animal movement are listed </span><span class="c7"><a class="c14" href="#h.1y810tw">below</a></span><span>, but overall it seems we can glean some strategic insight from the anti-abortion movement suitable for effective animal advocacy&mdash;that is, information that can be used to understand how to maximize the impact of interventions used.</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt1" id="ftnt_ref1">[1]</a></sup></p><p class="c9 c13"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c1">Importantly, this report makes no attempt to evaluate the goals of either movement. This report is exclusively about the strategy of social movements, and while we will discuss goals insofar as they are relevant to strategic discussion, we deliberately avoid any moral assessment.</span></p><p class="c9 c13"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c1">US farmed animal advocates tend to favor less restrictive abortion regulations, so we know that some might be hesitant to take seriously a report that looks for insight in the strategy of the anti-abortion movement. We think this is actually a strong reason to study this movement, because it is so different and therefore might have unusually interesting lessons to be gleaned. We hope readers will keep an open mind and attempt to examine the strategy of this movement, and other social movements, with an objective lens.</span></p><p class="c9 c13"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c1">This report provides a condensed history of the US anti-abortion movement, from the 1960s to the present. After providing this history, the report draws tentative conclusions about which strategies seemed to be most effective for the anti-abortion movement and suggests potential implications for the farmed animal movement&rsquo;s strategy. The focus of this report is on strategic insights for the farmed animal movement, but some insights may be useful for other movements as well.</span></p><p class="c9 c13"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c1">This report focuses on the US anti-abortion movement, rather than international efforts, for three reasons:</span></p><p class="c9 c13"><span class="c1"></span></p><ol class="c18 lst-kix_list_1-0 start" start="1"><li class="c9 c10"><span class="c1">It seems that abortion issues have been highly salient in US politics and society since the late 1960s, and especially since around 1980, compared to other countries. This suggests that both the anti-abortion movement and abortion rights movements would both have been larger in the US than in other countries that could have been studied and that there would be more content worth evaluating.</span></li><li class="c9 c10"><span>Much activity and research of the effective animal advocacy community has focused on the US.</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt2" id="ftnt_ref2">[2]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;This concentration of resources is at least partially justified by the strategic importance of the US as a country with a large number of animals in factory farmed conditions and substantial social, political, and economic influence over the rest of the world. Given the research gaps in our understanding of effective animal advocacy in the US,</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt3" id="ftnt_ref3">[3]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;it also seems reasonable to focus on coming to stronger conclusions for the optimal movement strategy in that context, before seeking to test whether those conclusions hold in other contexts.</span></li><li class="c9 c10"><span class="c1">After initial research on the topic, it became clear that there was a plethora of surveys, social scientific research, and historical research on the topic of abortion in the US. Limiting the breadth of content to the US only reduced the resources required to complete this report, hopefully without a correspondingly large loss to the completeness and usefulness of the report.</span></li></ol><p class="c9 c13"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c9"><span>This report was mainly undertaken as exploratory analysis, rather than being designed to test explicit hypotheses on strategic effectiveness, though the author initially suspected that the report would provide strategic insight into the question of whether a left-wing or nonpartisan focus is more desirable for the farmed animal movement, as well as other foundational questions in effective animal advocacy.</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt4" id="ftnt_ref4">[4]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;The author also believed that the anti-abortion movement had mostly failed at achieving its goals, and therefore the report would provide evidence that, on average, the tactics used by the anti-abortion movement should be avoided by the farmed animal movement. This is unlike most EAA case studies,</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt5" id="ftnt_ref5">[5]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;in which researchers have analyzed successful movements and therefore tend to take their use of a tactic as evidence of its effectiveness.</span></p><p class="c9 c13"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c9"><span>As with Sentience Institute&rsquo;s report on the British antislavery movement, </span><span class="c6">the farmed animal movement as this report describes it is weighted towards the US movement, so readers from other regions may see different similarities and differences between the US anti-abortion movement and their own region and movement, and should adjust the applicability of this report&rsquo;s conclusions to their own region&rsquo;s advocacy accordingly. This report assumes the reader has some knowledge of modern animal farming and animal advocacy.</span><sup class="c6 c0"><a href="#ftnt6" id="ftnt_ref6">[6]</a></sup></p><p class="c9 c13"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c9"><span>The anti-abortion movement is called a variety of names, including &ldquo;pro-life,&rdquo; &ldquo;right to life,&rdquo; and &ldquo;anti-choice.&rdquo; In comparison, the abortion rights movement is called &ldquo;pro-choice,&rdquo; &ldquo;pro-abortion,&rdquo; or &ldquo;pro-death.&rdquo;</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt7" id="ftnt_ref7">[7]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;In this report, the terms &ldquo;anti-abortion&rdquo; and &ldquo;abortion rights&rdquo; respectively for consistency. These terms are used to refer to the US movements specifically, rather than international movements. Given the US context, the term &ldquo;liberal&rdquo; when referring to abortion laws or attitudes implies greater support for abortion rights. What this report refers to as &ldquo;crisis pregnancy centers&rdquo; have been called a variety of names, including &ldquo;Birthright and Emergency Pregnancy Services (EPS),&rdquo; &ldquo;Problem Pregnancy Centers (PPCs),&rdquo; &ldquo;Pregnancy Resource Centers (PRCs),&rdquo; &ldquo;A Woman&#39;s Concern Health Centers,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Life Choices Medical Clinics.&rdquo;</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt8" id="ftnt_ref8">[8]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;Although the term is avoided here due to its imprecision, other authors sometimes use the term &ldquo;therapeutic abortions,&rdquo; which refers to abortions performed to protect the health (sometimes including mental health) or life of the mother. Abortions performed for other reasons are sometimes referred to as &ldquo;elective abortions.&rdquo;</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt9" id="ftnt_ref9">[9]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;The term &ldquo;fetus&rdquo; is used throughout this report.</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt10" id="ftnt_ref10">[10]</a></sup></p><p class="c9 c13"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c9"><span>Finally, this report borrows much of the methodology and framing of Sentience Institute&rsquo;s 2017 report on the British antislavery movement.</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt11" id="ftnt_ref11">[11]</a></sup></p><h2 class="c17" id="h.3znysh7"><span class="c4 c12">Summary of Key Implications</span></h2><p class="c9"><span>A single historical case study does not provide strong evidence for any particular claim; the value of these case studies comes from providing insight into a large number of important questions.</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt12" id="ftnt_ref12">[12]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;This section lists a number of strategic claims supported by the evidence in this report:</span></p><p class="c9 c13"><span class="c1"></span></p><ul class="c18 lst-kix_list_2-0 start"><li class="c9 c10"><span class="c1">Political parties are more willing than expected to modify their stance on controversial issues, even in a direction that seems contrary to the views of their existing supporter base.</span></li><li class="c9 c10"><span class="c1">Even if the theology of a particular religion has unclear implications for the moral issues of interest to social movements, a strong moral stance can still become normalized within a religious community that is highly influential in society at large.</span></li><li class="c9 c10"><span class="c1">Disruptive and confrontational tactics seem likely to be effective at reducing the supply of targeted products or services, but direct effects on demand are smaller. They may also increase issue salience among policymakers and the public. Activists using such tactics should strive to minimize possible negative effects, such as legal restrictions and damage to the credibility and reputation of the movement. Violent tactics seem generally unproductive but some disruptive tactics could be worth the associated risks as measured by activist goals.</span></li><li class="c9 c10"><span class="c1">Legislation that restricts access to abortions seems to have successfully reduced the number of abortions. Though the effect may be small, it is possible that it would be higher on products or services for which the demand is more elastic, such as animal products. This legislation does not seem to have substantially reduced the public&#39;s support for further incremental legislation.</span></li><li class="c9 c10"><span class="c1">For securing desired legislative outcomes at both the state and national levels, securing the support of politicians seems more important than favorable public opinion. A favorable legal environment (e.g. supportive judges) also seems important.</span></li><li class="c9 c10"><span class="c1">Expending substantial resources on encouraging legal change without popular support for the proposed measures seems inadvisable. Highly salient legal changes may provide momentum to opposition groups. Legal rulings seem to have little, if any, positive effect on public opinion regarding controversial issues, though they may consolidate support for issues that were already widely accepted. There is also some evidence that such changes may polarize opinion on controversial issues, although other analyses dispute this.</span></li><li class="c9 c10"><span class="c1">Close association with controversial interest groups may reduce the credibility and durability of a movement, and may lead to increased factionalism and polarization on relevant issues.</span></li><li class="c9 c10"><span class="c1">Stronger alignment with a major political party might temporarily speed up progress by increasing the rate at which legislation is proposed but may also increase the chances of longer-term stagnation by encouraging political deadlock on an issue that could otherwise have transcended party politics.</span></li><li class="c9 c10"><span class="c1">High issue salience may contribute to political polarization and, more tentatively, to stagnation. Advocates should only focus on increasing issue salience if the timing is beneficial.</span></li><li class="c9 c10"><span class="c1">Boycotts of specific companies across their entire product range may be a more promising tactic for disrupting the supply of a product than boycotts of a specific product type across all companies.

Over the next decade and a half, forty anti-abortion statutes were passed in the United States; by 1910 nearly every state had anti-abortion laws. Most of the laws contained a clause authorizing licensed physicians to perform therapeutic abortions, which finally provided the medical community with a monopoly over the issue.

Some doctors active in the antiabortion campaign believed that life was sacred.

Although the nineteenth-century women&rsquo;s movement was organized by the 1860s, the majority of feminists were primarily concerned with securing the vote for women. Like the antiabortion physicians, many of them considered abortions to be a degrading procedure that exploited women, and they supported the AMA&rsquo;s attempts to criminalize it.&rdquo; On page 34, Nossiff adds that &ldquo;The timing of the physicians&rsquo; campaign coincided with the wave of professionalization in public policy that followed the Civil War.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c8 c13"><span class="c4 c2"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c2">The social climate may also have been very different.

On pages 92-3, Olasky argues that &ldquo;In three ways 1962 was the year of the great leap forward for pro-abortion forces. First, in that year pro-abortion books and broadcasts designed for the general public, rather than elite audiences of doctors, lawyers, and liberal theologians, began to emerge&hellip; Second, the summer of 1962 brought with it a story of a double abortion murder,&rdquo; and third, the case of Sherri Finkbine.</span></p><p class="c8 c13"><span class="c4 c2"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c2">In a subsequent book, </span><span class="c6 c2">Abortion Rites: A Social History of Abortion in America </span><span class="c4 c2">(Wheaton, Illinois: Crossway Books, 1992), however, Olasky summarizes on page 283 that &ldquo;pro-life forces have been wrong to assume that abortion was rare in the nineteenth century, that tough laws virtually ended the practice, that doctors and ministers led the way, and that the anti-abortion consensus remained philosophically intact until the 1960s. Pro-abortion groups have been wrong, however, in their typical assertion that abortion was widely accepted before this century, that abortion was infused throughout the population, that abortion became illegal because regular doctors sought to drive out competitors, and that abortion rates generally are unaffected by illegality or the development of alternatives.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c8 c13"><span class="c4 c2"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c4 c2">His very speculative estimate on page 290 is that &ldquo;in 1860 there were roughly one hundred and sixty thousand American abortions, in a non-slave population of twenty-seven million. (There is very little accurate information about what was going on among slaves.) Roughly one hundred thousand of those one hundred and sixty thousand abortions were undergone by prostitutes.&rdquo; On page 291 he notes that he would be surprised if there were fewer than 100,000 abortions in 1860, given the evidence. 160,000 abortions works out as just under 6 abortions per 1,000 people (or just under 3 per 1,000 females, which the author of this report guesses should be approximately halved again to show approximate 1.5 abortions per 1,000 women aged 15-44 years.</span></p><p class="c8 c13"><span class="c4 c2"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c2">By comparison, Tara C.

These boards decided which abortions could be conducted. Luker argues that &ldquo;when there is no consensus about how to assess the criteria&mdash;as there increasingly was not in the 1950 and undoubtedly would not be today&mdash;there is an almost irresistible pull to degrade the system, to convert it into some other kind of system&hellip; As they degenerated from criteria systems into systems based on quotas and markets, their legitimacy became increasingly problematic both inside and outside the medical profession. This failure of legitimacy began to give rise to new feelings of discontent. As therapeutic &nbsp;abortion boards became perceived as more and more unworkable and unfair, physicians began to cast about for other resolutions of the dilemma. And the search for new resolutions was hampered by at least two important social developments: the changing locale of medical practice and the emergence of an institutionalized &lsquo;strict constructionist&rsquo; view of abortion.&rdquo; Many of these claims are uncited. Luker explains on page 46 that the term &ldquo;strict constructionists&rdquo; means &ldquo;those who accepted abortion only to preserve the physical life of the woman.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c8 c13"><span class="c4 c2"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c4 c2">Keith Cassidy, &ldquo;The Road to Roe: Cultural Change and the Growth of Acceptance of Abortion Prior to 1973,&rdquo; Life and Learning 7 (1998), 9 notes previous arguments (which he regards as &ldquo;inadequate&rdquo; explanations) that &ldquo;structural changes in women&rsquo;s lives and employment, the acceptance of birth-control and of the sense that control of fertility was a right, population anxieties, the civil-rights and anti-war movements, the youth culture of the 1960&rsquo;s, able leaders and particular events (such as the Finkbine case)&rdquo; contributed to &ldquo;the rapid and complete success of the call for an unlimited right to abortion.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c8 c13"><span class="c4 c2"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c4 c2">Instead, on pages 10-11 Cassidy ascribes a greater causal role to philosophical and intellectual shifts that &ldquo;made much less plausible the assertion that even in its early stages a fetus was fully human, whatever its appearance, and was entitled to the same absolute protection as any other human&rdquo; and to greater absolute rights, including for a woman&rsquo;s privacy over abortion.</span></p><p class="c8 c13"><span class="c4 c2"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c2">Nossiff, </span><span class="c6 c2">Before </span><span class="c4 c2">Roe, 34 notes that &ldquo;The AMA&rsquo;s control over abortion remained unchallenged until the 1950s&hellip; A study released in 1951, however, showed that a surprisingly high number of therapeutic abortions were still being performed by physicians, though most of the reasons they gave did not, strictly speaking, constitute legal grounds for the procedure.

Norway&rsquo;s 1960 reformed statute codified what had been common medical practice for years. All these countries permitted abortions for a wide range of therapeutic reasons. Before their latest revisions, for example, Denmark and Finland authorized the operation for the following: physical or mental illness that threatens the mother; rape or incest to women under a certain age; fetal abnormality; and a sociomedical provision that considered existing or potential physical and mental health problems caused by the mother&#39;s living conditions.

For example, on pages 97-8, Luker notes that the Society for Humane Abortions conducted &ldquo;leafletting, abortion teach-ins, and petitions&hellip; Finally, SHA began to take direct action by engaging in civil disobedience.&rdquo; On page 95, Luker claims that &ldquo;the drive for total repeal of abortion laws was carried forward by many evanescent organizations that formed for one &lsquo;action&rsquo; and then disbanded, fairly spontaneous public activities such as demonstrations, &lsquo;speak-outs,&rsquo; and &lsquo;street theaters.&rsquo; Although these activities were undoubtedly instrumental in changing the public climate, they left few records and are difficult to study after the fact.&rdquo; Hence, Luker focuses on the SHA. The year 1967 is treated by Luker as a watershed because that was the year in which California passed the Therapeutic Abortion Act, liberalizing Californian abortion law, with the result that &ldquo;by late 1970, of all women who applied for an abortion, 99.2 percent were granted one. By 1971 abortion was as frequent as it would ever become in California, and one out of every three pregnancies was ended by a legal abortion&rdquo; (described on pages 93-4). Luker doesn&rsquo;t seem to provide any other justification for 1967 being a turning point in terms of women&rsquo;s engagement in the movement; many of the changes that Luker describes are attributed to the 1960s generally.</span></p><p class="c8 c13"><span class="c4 c2"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c2">Williams, </span><span class="c6 c2">Defenders of the Unborn</span><span class="c4 c2">, 96, however, notes that, in the late 1960s, James McHugh of the NRLC &ldquo;encouraged bishops to recruit doctors and lawyers to lead the right-to-life committees.

Abortion opponents and pro-life activists responded by emphasizing not only the rights of fetuses but also the threat that population control reforms might pose to African-Americans and disabled Americans. Partly for this reason, some African-American leaders and members of the public who supported abortion after </span><span class="c6 c2">Roe </span><span class="c4 c2">opposed abortion reform when, before the decision, abortion was thought of as a method of population control.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c8 c13"><span class="c4 c2"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c4 c2">Ziegler describes on pages 291-6 the increased role played by groups including the Population Council and Zero Population Growth, Incorporated (ZPG) in the late 1960s and early 1970s.

For example, Ziegler notes on page 320 that, &ldquo;[b]y early 1972, NOW had renamed its abortion task force the &lsquo;Task Force for Reproduction and Its Control and the Development of Population Policy.&rsquo; In February of that year, the NOW Board considered partnering with the Ford Foundation on a population control study.

From that humble start, Golden founded the New York State Right to Life Committee in 1967&hellip; Golden contacted the NRLC and soon began receiving material.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c8 c13"><span class="c4 c2"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c4 c2">Other descriptions in the article present the foundation of new groups as autonomous decisions by local advocates, although their relationship with the NRLC is not explicitly discussed, so it is unclear whether the group played any role, but the narrative reads as if it did not.

Many state Catholic conferences failed to meet this tight deadline&hellip; Nevertheess, McHugh&rsquo;s directive shapped the course of the pro-life movement for at least the next five years. The pro-life mmovement would be led by laypeople, with the bishops playing a less public role, and it would be organized primarily at the state level, with the NRLC providing a limited degree of national coordination. While many of the right-to-life organizations engaged in public educational efforts and other activities, they were created for one central purpose: lobbying their state legislatures to defeat all abortion law reform proposals.&rdquo;</span></p></div><div><p class="c8"><a href="#ftnt_ref83" id="ftnt83">[83]</a><span class="c2">&nbsp;&ldquo;Fighting the &lsquo;Hurricane Winds&rsquo; of Abortion Liberalization: Americans United for Life and the Struggle for Self-Definition before </span><span class="c6 c2">Roe v.

This may be humiliating to him.

In 1970, they did not put up the same fight&hellip; [Republican senate majority leader Earl Brydges&rsquo;] historic support for the Church&rsquo;s cause and his previous unwillingness to bring abortion bills to the floor had given the bishops the false impression that the senate was more staunchly opposed to abortion than it actually was, and they underestimated the effect that Brydges&rsquo; unexpected acquiescence would have on the legislative body over which he presided. As late as March&mdash;nearly two months after Brydges&rsquo;s staff had drafted an abortion legalizaton bill for the senator to introduce&mdash;the New York diocesan paper Catholic News continued to describe Brydges as &lsquo;an opponent of loosening the present safeguards on abortion in the state&rsquo;... the reports on the abortion bill that appeared in the Catholic News only one week before the senate vote on the measure gave no indication that the bishops thought the bill would pass or that they considered the matter an urgent priority. The Catholic News headline &lsquo;Latest Abortion Bill Seen as No Different from Rest&rsquo; hardly seemed calculated to alarm the faithful, so it was not surprising that state legislators reproted receiving few letters protesting the bill.&rdquo; On page 126, Williams describes how the bishops and anti-abortion activists became more active once the bill passed through the state&rsquo;s Senate, lobbying legislators and organizing demonstrations.</span></p></div><div><p class="c8"><a href="#ftnt_ref103" id="ftnt103">[103]</a><span class="c2">&nbsp;Williams, </span><span class="c6 c2">Defenders of the Unborn</span><span class="c4 c2">, 125-6 notes that the Republican senate majority leader Earl Brydges &ldquo;had overestimated the strength of this pro-life coalition [of Republicans and socially conservative Democrats].

But he had miscalculated. At the last minute, perceiving a wave of support for a bill that he had thought would be viewed as too extreme, he announced his opposition to the measure that he had helped to bring to the floor.

In Wyoming, Indiana, and Illinois, they succeeded in getting abortion law repeal bills killed in committee. In Colorado and Montana, they defeated abortion law repeal bills on the House or Senate floor. One of their most striking successes occurred in Mississippi, where a state right-to-life organization orchestrated a letter-writing campaign that flooded state legislators&rsquo; mailboxes with petitions against an abortion law repeal bill. When pro-lifers brought a coalition of hundreds of people, including not only Catholics but also Baptists and Jews, to speak against the abortion bill, the committee voted eleven to two to kill it.

Prior to 1970, the state right-to-life organization that Edward Golden chaired was small and mostly ineffective; the Catholic Church in the state, rather than grassroots right-to-life organizations, was forced to take the lead in lobbying Albany when the legislature had debated abortion legalization. But immediately after New York passed its abortion law, Golden&rsquo;s Right to Life Committee began growing exponentially. By the spring of 1972, the committee had fifty county chapters and at least 200,000 members.&rdquo; Williams also notes on page 194 that Al Fortman, the president of the North Dakota Right to Life Association, who led anti-abortion resistance to proposed reform in that state in 1972, &ldquo;had been sympathetic to some therapeutic abortion reform laws in the late 1960s, but after unrestricted first- and second-trimester abortions became legal in New York and several other states, he changed his mind.&rdquo;</span></p></div><div><p class="c8"><a href="#ftnt_ref108" id="ftnt108">[108]</a><span class="c4 c2">&nbsp;Ibid, 175-7.

AUL was less focused on the specifics of the medical procedure. Graphic images of abortion appeared in </span><span class="c6 c2">Abortion and Social Justice</span><span class="c4 c2">, but there were only four pictures, and they came after almost 270 pages of dense legal, medical, and social analysis. The images were supplemental rather than a constitutive part of the argument, in contrast to Willke&rsquo;s heavy emphasis on the visual.

But Pennsylvania significantly expanded restrictions on abortion by prohibiting the public funding of abortions unless the woman&rsquo;s health or life was in danger&mdash;a restriction that proved to be widely popular on the state level in the period after Roe.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c8 c13"><span class="c4 c2"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c2">On page 150, Nossiff adds that, &ldquo;[w]ithin the next five years, the courts ruled on the constitutionality of several of the act&rsquo;s provisions.

Thus, when Christopher Tietze began a 1975 study about the rate of legal abortions and abortion-related deaths, the Council no longer sponsored his research, and he instead pursued funding from Planned Parenthood&rsquo;s Guttmacher Institute. Between 1974 and 1978, after Third World leaders at the 1974 UN Conference criticized population control initiatives, the Council also publicized domestic research on the safety of oral contraception rather than international programs or abortion studies.&rdquo; Ziegler adds that, &ldquo;[a]s population control arguments stopped playing a role in the abortion debate, ZPG [Zero Population Growth, Incorporated] stopped focusing exclusively on protecting abortion rights or even on access to contraception. In the summer of 1974, ZPG Executive Director, Robert Dennis, spoke publicly about a proposal by the organization to restrict legal immigration by 90 percent&hellip; This new emphasis was evident even into the late 1970s as ZPG&rsquo;s involvement in pro-reform advocacy continued to decline. Instead of lobbying for funding for abortions or the appointment of pro-choice judges, ZPG joined the 1977 call for federally-funded &lsquo;alternatives&rsquo; to abortion and continued arguing that immigration policy was a central part of population control.&rdquo;</span></p></div><div><p class="c8"><a href="#ftnt_ref154" id="ftnt154">[154]</a><span class="c2">&nbsp;Ziegler, &ldquo;The Framing of a Right to Choose,&rdquo; 308-12 shows that Planned Parenthood continued to use population control arguments for several years after </span><span class="c6 c2">Roe</span><span class="c2">; the shift appears to have occurred gradually, in response to various events in the 1970s. There was at least some explicit effort to focus on the arguments used in </span><span class="c6 c2">Roe</span><span class="c2">.

Those present at the conference saw Planned Parenthood&rsquo;s support for population control as a vulnerability, because pro-life organizers had successfully &lsquo;sought to exploit to their own advantages the fears of minorities&rdquo; (Memorandum, 4).

In a flurry of letters to Congress, individuals and organizations criticized the decision&rsquo;s holding that the fetus was not a person and that women had a right to abortion.

If the state recognized a right to choose to bear a child, as Mecklenburg argued, then the state had to guarantee women the means to raise that child.

As Skowronek puts it, it was an &ldquo;autobiographical campaign&rdquo; (1993, 374). A vote for Carter was not a vote for the agenda of the Democratic Party; it was a vote for who Carter was and what he personally represented. What he was, was a man of Christian faith whose public pronouncements reverberated with Biblical undertones. And Jimmy Carter was not just any Christian. According to Tom Wolfe (1983, 271), he was a member of the &ldquo;Missionary lecternpounding Amen ten-finder C-major-chord Sister-Martha at the Yamaha-keyboard loblolly piney-woods Baptist faith in which the members of the congregation stand up and &lsquo;give witness&rsquo; and &lsquo;share it, Brother&rsquo; and &lsquo;share it, Sister&rsquo; and &lsquo;praise God&rsquo; during the service.&rdquo; Carter actively identified himself with &ldquo;born-again&rdquo; evangelicalism.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c8 c13"><span class="c4 c2"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c4 c2">On page 32, they claim that &ldquo;Unsurprisingly, his candidacy inspired the evangelical community. &lsquo;Surely the Lord sent Jimmy Carter,&rdquo; said Daddy King [Martin Luther King Sr.] to the Democratic Party convention in 1976 &ldquo;to come on out and bring America back where she belongs.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></p></div><div><p class="c8"><a href="#ftnt_ref173" id="ftnt173">[173]</a><span class="c2">&nbsp;For more evidence of his assurances of the importance of his faith to his politics, see Andrew R.

On his difference from the politics of most evangelicals, the authors summarize on page 35 that &ldquo;In practice, however, Christian conservatives quickly became disillusioned with the Carter presidency. His advocacy of the Equal Rights Amendment and gay rights, and his failure to support mandatory prayer in public schools or to move to ban abortion were all anathema to their religious principles. On the international stage, his efforts toward arms control and the Panama Canal Treaty smacked of misplaced idealism at best and unholy accommodation with godless Communism at worst. As early as 1978, evangelicals began to feel disillusionment with the Carter White House. By 1979, they had coalesced as the New Religious or Christian Right and were actively campaigning for his removal from office.&rdquo;</span></p></div><div><p class="c8"><a href="#ftnt_ref174" id="ftnt174">[174]</a><span class="c4 c2">&nbsp;Ibid, 42-7. They note, for example, that Religious Liaison Reverend Maddox repeatedly advised Carter to reach out to the conservative Christian leaders, but he did not meet them until January 22, 1980. Shortly afterwards, &ldquo;Jerry Falwell, the founder of the largest of the Christian Right organizations, the Moral Majority, publicly attacked Carter for his stance on gay rights and accused him of attempting to woo homosexual voters by giving public approval of their &lsquo;sinful&rsquo; lifestyle.&rdquo; This was after these leaders had held meetings with several Republican candidates. They add that &ldquo;Their bitterness, Maddox recalled, led Christian conservative leaders to denounce Carter &lsquo;as the anti-Christ,&rsquo; and when newspaper columnist Bob Novak attended a conference of conservative preachers in 1979, he observed minister after minister declaring &lsquo;I was part of Carter&rsquo;s team in 1976. I delivered my congregation for Carter. I urged them all to vote for Carter because I thought he was a moral individual. I found out otherwise, and I&rsquo;m angry&rsquo;... The conservative evangelical community, now politically activated as the Christian Right, instead turned to Ronald Reagan in 1980, a candidate who more carefully articulated their agenda. This was despite the fact that Reagan&rsquo;s nominal religious credentials bore no comparison to Carter&rsquo;s genuine piety. Reagan did not regularly attend religious services.&rdquo;</span></p></div><div><p class="c8"><a href="#ftnt_ref175" id="ftnt175">[175]</a><span class="c4 c2">&nbsp;Karrer, &ldquo;The Pro-Life Movement,&rdquo; 64.</span></p></div><div><p class="c8"><a href="#ftnt_ref176" id="ftnt176">[176]</a><span class="c4 c2">&nbsp;Cassidy, &ldquo;The Right to Life Movement,&rdquo; 149.</span></p></div><div><p class="c8"><a href="#ftnt_ref177" id="ftnt177">[177]</a><span class="c4 c2">&nbsp;Karrer, &ldquo;The Pro-Life Movement,&rdquo; 67-9.</span></p></div><div><p class="c8"><a href="#ftnt_ref178" id="ftnt178">[178]</a><span class="c4 c2">&nbsp;&ldquo;Convention to propose amendments to the United States Constitution,&rdquo; Wikipedia, last edited July 10, 2019, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_to_propose_amendments_to_the_United_States_Constitution.</span></p></div><div><p class="c8"><a href="#ftnt_ref179" id="ftnt179">[179]</a><span class="c4 c2">&nbsp;Karrer, &ldquo;The Pro-Life Movement,&rdquo; 67-9.</span></p></div><div><p class="c8"><a href="#ftnt_ref180" id="ftnt180">[180]</a><span class="c4 c2">&nbsp;Karrer, &ldquo;The Pro-Life Movement,&rdquo; 70 notes that &ldquo;In 1977, violence erupted at abortion facilities across the country.

Among the suggestions offered by the staffers were the following: (a) transfer program funds from groups that promote or otherwise support abortions to those that assist with adoptions, (b) end tax deductions for medical expenses associated with abortions, (c) direct the Surgeon General to develop and disseminate pamphlets warning of the medical hazards of abortion, and (d) veto every bill allowing federal dollars to be spent on abortion.</span></p></div><div><p class="c8"><a href="#ftnt_ref223" id="ftnt223">[223]</a><span class="c2">&nbsp;Prendergast, </span><span class="c6 c2">The Catholic Voter</span><span class="c4 c2">, 198.</span></p></div><div><p class="c8"><a href="#ftnt_ref224" id="ftnt224">[224]</a><span class="c2">&nbsp;See the point about &ldquo;Boycotts of specific companies&rdquo; in the section on &ldquo;</span><span class="c7 c2"><a class="c14" href="#h.qsh70q">Consumer Action and Individual Behavioral Change</a></span><span class="c4 c2">.&rdquo;</span></p></div><div><p class="c8"><a href="#ftnt_ref225" id="ftnt225">[225]</a><span class="c2">&nbsp;&ldquo;Electoral College Box Scores 1789-1996,&rdquo; National Archives and Records Administration, US Electoral College, accessed October 22, 2019, </span><span class="c7 c2"><a class="c14" href="https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/scores.html">https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/scores.html</a></span><span class="c4 c2">.</span></p></div><div><p class="c8"><a href="#ftnt_ref226" id="ftnt226">[226]</a><span class="c2">&nbsp;See David Karol, </span><span class="c6 c2">Party Position Change in American Politics: Coalition Management </span><span class="c4 c2">(New York: Cambridge University Press, 2009), 67-74 for the narrative of his switch.</span></p></div><div><p class="c8"><a href="#ftnt_ref227" id="ftnt227">[227]</a><span class="c2">&nbsp;Prendergast, </span><span class="c6 c2">The Catholic Voter</span><span class="c4 c2">, 196 notes that &ldquo;The Democratic platform of 1984 echoed the 1980 platform&rsquo;s stand on abortion.

There were three primary reasons for the failure of the first wave of the New Christian Right. First, the social movement organizations made no real effort to build at the grassroots and had few active local chapters. Jeffrey Hadden et al. reported that their study revealed no evidence of a functioning grassroots structure and argued that &lsquo;the Moral Majority was primarily an organization for grabbing media attention, built and supported by direct-mail technology.&rsquo; Second, religious prejudices made for narrow coalitions, with Moral Majority leaders especially intolerant of Catholics, Pentecostals, and mainline Protestants. Finally, the movement made little attempt to market its message to a broader audience, serving up the same heated rhetoric to the press and public that it used to motivate its activists.&rdquo;</span></p></div><div><p class="c8"><a href="#ftnt_ref229" id="ftnt229">[229]</a><span class="c2">&nbsp;Mark J.

Some activists claimed that the movement had matured and that it could now be considered part of the conservative mainstream. Critics charged that the Christian Right was adopting a moderate face to win elections, but that the fundamental agenda remained unchanged. Matthew Moen argues that the new organizations of the Christian Right differed from those that came before in several key ways. First, the organizations of the 1990s abandoned the language of moral crusade in favor of appeals based on the &lsquo;rights talk&rsquo; of liberalism. Second, the groups emphasized politics over moral reform and attempted to build political coalitions. In this way, Moen argues, they became more secular. Finally, the new organizations were far more sophisticated than those that went before, primarily because of the influx of a new cadre of skilled leaders.&rdquo;</span></p></div><div><p class="c8"><a href="#ftnt_ref230" id="ftnt230">[230]</a><span class="c2">&nbsp;Nossiff, </span><span class="c6 c2">Before </span><span class="c4 c2">Roe, 9.</span></p></div><div><p class="c8"><a href="#ftnt_ref231" id="ftnt231">[231]</a><span class="c2">&nbsp;Doan, </span><span class="c6 c2">Opposition &amp; Intimidation</span><span class="c4 c2">, 92.

The exact wording of the abortion item is: &lsquo;Should abortion be legal as it is now, or legal only in such cases as rape, incest, or to save the life of the mother, or should it not be permitted at all?&rsquo; The responses to this three-pronged abortion question used in the CBS/New York Times surveys indicate that a significant shift in opinion occurred during the 1980s, whereby the public became more supportive of legalized abortion &lsquo;as it is now.&rsquo; At the same time, the public became less supportive of further restrictions on abortion.

The GOP equivalent, the WISH List, contributed just over $1,000,000 to pro-choice female Republican candidates in the same period. When we look at the formally nonpartisan lobbies focused on abortion the story is similar. Already by the 1989-1990 campaign cycle, the leading pro-choice groups, the National Abortion Rights Action League (NARAL) and Planned Parenthood, were giving 89 percent and 98 percent of their contributions, respectively, to Democratic congressional candidates, while the National Right to Life Committee sent 85 percent of their donations to Republicans.

The General Social Survey data shows that a large majority of the population has consistently supported the right to abortion if there is a strong chance of serious defect for the child, the woman&rsquo;s health is seriously endangered, or the woman is pregnant as a result of rape. In contrast, support for the right to abortion for any reason, because the woman is not married, or because the woman wants no more children has remained a minority, while support and opposition to the right to abortion for those who cannot afford more children due to low incomes have both fluctuated between about 40% and 60%. For the right to abortion in each of these cases (except abortion for any reason, which was not measured in 1973), comparing the mean of the most recent three years in which the survey was carried out (2008, 2010, and 2012) to a similar spread of surveys in 1973, 1975, and 1977 reveals a increase in opposition of between 1% and 10% (the mean increase in opposition was 6.5% and the mean decrease in support was also 6.5%).</span></p></div><div><p class="c8"><a href="#ftnt_ref332" id="ftnt332">[332]</a><span class="c4 c2">&nbsp;This is suggested by the findings from &ldquo;In Depth: Topics A to Z: Abortion,&rdquo; Gallup, accessed March 20, 2019, https://news.gallup.com/poll/1576/abortion.aspx; in May 2018, 48% of respondents considered themselves to be pro-life, but only 18% believed that abortion should be illegal in all circumstances.</span></p><p class="c8 c13"><span class="c4 c2"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c2">Even the largest, most mainstream anti-abortion advocacy group, National Right to Life, implies that its mission involves ending all abortion: &ldquo;The mission of National Right to Life is to protect and defend the most fundamental right of humankind, the right to life of every innocent human being from the beginning of life to natural death&rdquo; (&ldquo;National Right to Life Mission Statement,&rdquo; National Right to Life Committee, accessed 05/03/19, https://www.nrlc.org/site/about/mission/).

They note that &ldquo;In general, public opinion is much more accepting of sex outside of marriage than it was in the 1970s, gender role attitudes have moved in a direction more supportive of equality between the sexes, and female participation in the paid labor force has increased dramatically during this period.

In 1972, 70% of respondents reported that they would vote for a woman president, which had risen to 95% by 2010. Slightly challenging the evidence of more liberal attitudes on a variety of sex and gender related issues, 22% of respondents in 1986 believed that birth control should be available to teens (14-16) if the parents don&#39;t approve; this number has fluctuated between 22% and 30%, with 28% agreeing in 2018.

Given an unlimited number of choices to name important issues, more respondents (33 percent of the total) cited abortion than any other single issue. In 1984, in response to a parallel question, somewhat differently phrased, 15 percent of those surveyed included abortion among the important issues. This poll reported that Bush received the vote of 57 percent of those who regarded abortion as important and Dukakis the vote of 42 percent.

A single decision to eat or avoid animal products only has, in most cases, immediate consequences that last a few minutes, if effects on animals, health, and the environment are not counted. Relatedly, since eating behaviors are much more regular, it is more difficult to legally circumvent state laws by going to a different state to purchase the product or service. If animal product demand is more elastic, this means that increases in the price and disruptions in the supply of animal products (whether through legislative change or direct activism) would be more likely to be effective in reducing consumption, although this also means that changes in the opposite direction could have a stronger effect on increasing consumption.</span></p></div><div><p class="c8"><a href="#ftnt_ref374" id="ftnt374">[374]</a><span class="c2">&nbsp;See, for example, Isabel Wilkerson, &ldquo;Drive Against Abortion Finds a Symbol: Wichita&rdquo; (August 4, 1991), </span><span class="c2"><a class="c14" href="https://www.nytimes.com/1991/08/04/us/drive-against-abortion-finds-a-symbol-wichita.html">https://www.nytimes.com/1991/08/04/us/drive-against-abortion-finds-a-symbol-wichita.html</a></span><span class="c4 c2">.</span></p></div><div><p class="c8"><a href="#ftnt_ref375" id="ftnt375">[375]</a><span class="c4 c2">&nbsp;&ldquo;GDP-by-Industry,&rdquo; US Department of Commerce Bureau of Economic Analysis, last updated April 19, 2019, https://www.bea.gov/iTable/iTable.cfm?ReqID=51#reqid=51&amp;step=51&amp;isuri=1&amp;5114=a&amp;5102=1</span></p></div><div><p class="c8"><a href="#ftnt_ref376" id="ftnt376">[376]</a><span class="c2">&nbsp;Tara C.

Even so, it is plausible that certain tactics used towards companies or institutions could be replicated, or that opponents could simply become wise to the tactics being used by the farmed animal movement and plan for methods to counter these tactics.</span></p><p class="c8 c13"><span class="c4 c2"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c2">The anti-abortion movement is, itself, perceived by some as a counter-movement.

As Herbert Haines shows in Black Radicals and the Civil Rights Mainstream, 194-70 (Knoxville, 1988), this effect can be either negative or positive. In the case of the civil rights movement, Haines found a positive radical-flank effect when black power groups came into the movement. As a result of their presence, the resources of moderate civil rights organizations increased as contributions came in from those who preferred the moderate goals of integration and civil rights to the radical goals of separatism and black power. In this instance, however, the moderate groups had already established the legitimacy of their cause and had gained widespread public sympathy prior to the emergence of the black power movement. Anti-abortion groups, however, have always had to battle with abortion rights groups for the moral upper hand (and there have always been some more radical groups within the anti-abortion movement). Consequently, moderate groups were not able to establish themselves as the proponents of an undeniably just cause like civil rights before a highly visible radical flank entered their movement.&rdquo;</span></p></div><div><p class="c8"><a href="#ftnt_ref410" id="ftnt410">[410]</a><span class="c2">&nbsp;See, for example, Rebecca J.

If morality policy is characterized by technical simplicity and framed in terms of core values, the most common liberalizing policies do not really fit the bill... Instead, they are framed in terms of safety, equal access to medical care, or free speech.

In areas where a murder has occurred, we observe declines in abortions and providers nearly 10 times the size of the average effect, albeit imprecisely measured due to the infrequency of murders. Because murder generates substantially less property damage than arson and bombing, one might infer that the effects of violence we measure are not purely mechanical (i.e., effects due to clinic closings). Additionally, the effect size is not correlated with the dollar value of damage, suggesting that our estimates capture some behavioral response, rather than an incapacitation response, to terror. The reductions in abortions and providers persist for several years after an attack.&rdquo; They note that &ldquo;In the 7-11 months following an anti-abortion attack, births increase by about 1 percent among women residing in targeted areas. In the long run, births are unaffected. The short-run rise in births accounts for only 10 percent of the decline in abortions in affected areas.

The activists also switched the timing of sit-ins from weekends to weekdays and back again as abortionists adjusted their schedules, apparently in response to the pressures of activism. Each change of location or timing reduced the number of people sitting-in. Scheduling conflicts undoubtedly accounted for some reduction in participation; however, many people welcomed changes as an excuse to stop doing something that was personally costly, frightening, and difficult. As one activist put it, &lsquo;This stuff is so uncomfortable personally &mdash; it&rsquo;s terrifying. We&rsquo;re all scared, especially where people had families and children and jobs in the lurch. I think all of us wanted a way out&rsquo;...

One small manufacturer, even, suggested that a boycott can be helpful to a small company. Unlike a large company, the manufacturer suggested that a boycott will not damage a small company&#39;s reputation, but that a small company will thrive on the publicity. Also, estimated profits might be trivial to a large company, compared with its other products, but such profits could be large for a smaller company.

By 1971 abortion was as frequent as it would ever become in California, and one out of every three pregnancies was ended by a legal abortion.&rdquo; If abortion was already freely available in California, then backlash there seems unlikely to have been against any increase in the availability of abortion caused by the ruling. To explain the backlash, on pages 139-40, Luker notes that &ldquo;reform physicians in California originally claimed that the Beilenson bill [which liberalized abortion law in California in 1967] would do little more than &lsquo;clarify&rsquo; the legal grounds for the sort of abortions they were doing anyway and that the deletion from the bill (under threat of a veto by Governor Reagan) of a clause permitting abortion for &lsquo;fetal indications&rsquo; removed any explicit challenge to the belief that the embryo is a full human life. Pro-life people could believe, therefore, that the principle they cherished was still safe, that only the decision rules about how to weigh one life against another had been modified. Equally important, the new California law said that the abortion decision had to be made not by the woman involved, nor even by the woman and her doctor, but by a panel of three doctors&mdash;in effect, by representatives of the medical community. Thus, from the pro-life point of view, abortion was still medical, still the taking of a human life, and still wrong, except in extraordinary circumstances. The Supreme Court decision changed all that. It demonstrated that an unwillingness to discuss abortion in public did not necessarily imply a commitment to the sacredness of embryonic life. Moreover, the Court not only discussed abortion but finally addressed the issue of personhood in an explicit way. As the Court itself put it in </span><span class="c6 c2">Roe v. Wade</span><span class="c4 c2">: &lsquo;All this&hellip; persuades us that the word &lsquo;person&rsquo; as used in the Fourteenth Amendment does not include the unborn.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></p></div><div><p class="c8"><a href="#ftnt_ref539" id="ftnt539">[539]</a><span class="c2">&nbsp;In the four interview quotes that Luker, </span><span class="c6 c2">Abortion and the Politics of Motherhood</span><span class="c2">,</span><span class="c6 c2">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">137-41 uses to attest to the incitement to anti-abortion activism provided by </span><span class="c6 c2">Roe v.

Who gave the Supreme Court the right to give life? You know it took this power by itself.&rdquo; This quote could also be interpreted as displaying anger at the discrepancy between the Supreme Court&rsquo;s ruling and public opinion. A quote from another interviewee demonstrates this factor more directly: &ldquo;After I&rsquo;d felt so good about those states voting [the legalization of abortion] down in the referendums&hellip; [the Supreme Court ruling] very much upset me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c8 c13"><span class="c4 c2"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c4 c2">Another issue with Luker&rsquo;s argument is that, even though abortion incidence was already high in California, some of those opposed to abortion may have simply been unaware that the incidence and medical acceptance of abortion for non-therapeutic reasons was as high as it was.</span></p></div><div><p class="c8"><a href="#ftnt_ref540" id="ftnt540">[540]</a><span class="c4 c2">&nbsp;Wlezien and Goggin, &ldquo;The Courts,&rdquo; 381&ndash;405.</span></p></div><div><p class="c8"><a href="#ftnt_ref541" id="ftnt541">[541]</a><span class="c4 c2">&nbsp;See the paragraph beginning &ldquo;In 1970, Hawaii legalized abortions&hellip;&rdquo; in &ldquo;A Condensed Chronological History of the Anti-Abortion Movement.&rdquo;</span></p></div><div><p class="c8"><a href="#ftnt_ref542" id="ftnt542">[542]</a><span class="c4 c2">&nbsp;See footnote 78.</span></p></div><div><p class="c8"><a href="#ftnt_ref543" id="ftnt543">[543]</a><span class="c2">&nbsp;See the paragraph beginning &ldquo;In the years after </span><span class="c6 c2">Roe&hellip;</span><span class="c4 c2">&rdquo; in &ldquo;A Condensed Chronological History of the Anti-Abortion Movement.&rdquo;</span></p></div><div><p class="c8"><a href="#ftnt_ref544" id="ftnt544">[544]</a><span class="c4 c2">&nbsp;Ziegler, &ldquo;The Framing of a Right to Choose,&rdquo; 326 notes that, &ldquo;[a] February [1971] poll taken by the Chicago Defender found that while only 26.4% of African-Americans generally opposed abortion reform, 63.7% of those polled professed a belief that government-funded abortions could lead to &lsquo;mass genocide in the black community.&rsquo; A poll conducted later that year by researchers at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst among several hundred African-American members of a New England city found a lower percent of respondents were convinced that abortion would actually result in black genocide, but among males under thirty, the study found that almost half believed that legalized abortion would lead to black genocide.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c8 c13"><span class="c4 c2"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c4 c2">Ziegler notes on pages 328-9 that, &ldquo;[b]y marginalizing population control arguments, Roe helped to focus the abortion debate on the issue of abortion rights. This inevitably affected the opinions of some African-Americans and members of other minority ethnic, racial, or religious groups who had felt threatened by population control politics. A published study on race and views on abortion confirms this view. Drawing on the pooled poll responses collected by the General Social Surveys (conducted by the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago) between 1972 and 1980, the study examined the attitudes of blacks and whites with respect to abortion in three two-year periods (1972&ndash;74, 1975&ndash;77, and 1978&ndash;80). Controlling for a variety of factors likely to determine a person&rsquo;s views on abortion, including family income, years of education, region of residence, frequency of church attendance, and religious denomination, the study found that, in the two years before Roe, being African-American was, in its own right, a statistically significant predictor that a person would be opposed to abortion reform. In the period three years after Roe, being African-American was no longer a statistically significant predictor of opposition to legalized abortion. Similarly, as the abortion debate focused on rights-based arguments, African-American leaders also changed their positions on abortion. Jesse Jackson, who had led a &lsquo;war against abortion,&rsquo; had described abortion as a threat to African-Americans. In 1983, when Jackson declared his intention to run for the Democratic presidential nomination, he promised feminist leaders to defend a woman&rsquo;s right to choose abortion.&rdquo;</span></p></div><div><p class="c8"><a href="#ftnt_ref545" id="ftnt545">[545]</a><span class="c2">&nbsp;See, for example, Ed Kilgore, &ldquo;Gillibrand Offers Explicit Abortion Rights Litmus Test for Judicial Nominees&rdquo; (May 7, 2019), </span><span class="c7 c2"><a class="c14" href="http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/05/gillibrand-offers-abortion-rights-litmus-test-for-judges.html">http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/05/gillibrand-offers-abortion-rights-litmus-test-for-judges.html</a></span><span class="c4 c2">.</span></p></div><div><p class="c8"><a href="#ftnt_ref546" id="ftnt546">[546]</a><span class="c2">&nbsp;Prendergast, </span><span class="c6 c2">The Catholic Voter</span><span class="c4 c2">, 260 notes that &ldquo;The Court&rsquo;s decision in Roe was written by Justice Blackmun, whom President Nixon appointed to the Supreme Court in 1970, and supported by other of Nixon&rsquo;s conservative appointees, including Lewis Powell, who during the Court&rsquo;s deliberations actually advocated lengthening the time period in which women&rsquo;s abortion decision was protected.&rdquo;</span></p></div><div><p class="c8"><a href="#ftnt_ref547" id="ftnt547">[547]</a><span class="c4 c2">&nbsp;See the point beginning &ldquo;Political parties are more willing&hellip;&rdquo; below.</span></p></div><div><p class="c8"><a href="#ftnt_ref548" id="ftnt548">[548]</a><span class="c4 c2">&nbsp;See footnote 170.</span></p></div><div><p class="c8"><a href="#ftnt_ref549" id="ftnt549">[549]</a><span class="c4 c2">&nbsp;The only abortion rights appointment by a Republican president was John Paul Stevens (Ford). </span></p><p class="c8 c13"><span class="c4 c2"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c4 c2">The anti-abortion appointments by Republicans were Antonin Scalia (Reagan), (Robert Bork was rejected under Reagan), Anthony Kennedy (Reagan; Terence P.

Controlling for the endogeneity of travel distance, the results suggest that pregnant women who reside in counties with longer travel distances to the nearest abortion provider have lower probabilities of aborting their pregnancies than women in counties closer to abortion providers.

Ohsfeldt and Gohmann (1994) found that parental involvement laws reduced adolescent (ages 15&ndash;17) abortion rates by 18% over the period 1984&ndash;1988. Haas-Wilson (1993) estimated that the 1988 teenage abortion rate was 16% lower in states with parental involvement laws as compared to states without these laws. In a similar paper, Haas-Wilson (1996) estimated that parental involvement laws decreased teenage abortion demand by 13&ndash;25% between 1978 and 1990. The problem with these studies, as noted by Meier et al. (1996), is that restrictive laws may be endogenous. States with low abortion rates (e.g. Utah) may be the states that enact restrictive abortion regulations. Meier examined 23 different abortion restrictions enacted by states between 1982 and 1992 and found no evidence that these restrictions, either individually or aggregated, statistically or numerically reduced a state&rsquo;s abortion rate. One reason for the Meier result may be that by 1992 almost all state restrictive laws were merely symbolic, not actively enforced, or enjoined until the U.S. Supreme Court settled the issue in a case currently being heard.&rdquo;</span></p></div><div><p class="c8"><a href="#ftnt_ref588" id="ftnt588">[588]</a><span class="c2">&nbsp;New, &ldquo;Analyzing the Effect of State Legislation.&rdquo; The rate of change seems greater than that which can be explained by the decline in the number of high school students reporting to currently be sexually active.

Using the latest figures on total annual abortions (638,169 in 2015 according to Tara C. Jatlaoui, Maegan E. Boutot, Michele G. Mandel; Maura K. Whiteman, Angeline Ti, Emily Petersen, and Karen Pazol, &ldquo;Abortion Surveillance &mdash; United States, 2015,&rdquo; </span><span class="c6 c2">Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report Surveillance Summaries </span><span class="c4 c2">67, no. SS13 (2018), 1-45), this would represent approximately 1.6% of total annual abortions in the US. However, it is possible that parental involvement laws also have an indirect effect on the abortion rate of adults. Additionally, the comparison is made between the abortion rates of minors and the total abortion rate (as opposed to the abortion rates of adults). These two factors suggest that the 10,100 abortions per year figure might underestimate the effectiveness of the parental involvement laws.</span></p></div><div><p class="c8"><a href="#ftnt_ref589" id="ftnt589">[589]</a><span class="c4 c2">&nbsp;Ibid. New notes that &ldquo;if value shifts, not legislation per se, are responsible for declining abortion rates, then states where the legislation was upheld and states where the legislation was nullified would be expected to experience similar declines in the abortion rate. However, if the legislation is responsible for the declines, then states that upheld their legislation would experience, on average, significantly larger reductions in their abortion rates than would be experienced by states where judiciaries struck down the laws.&rdquo;</span></p></div><div><p class="c8"><a href="#ftnt_ref590" id="ftnt590">[590]</a><span class="c4 c2">&nbsp;Childress, &ldquo;Advocacy, Abortion, and Public Policy,&rdquo; 40-7.

Recognition was given also to the several decisions in state and federal courts which show a further trend toward liberalization of abortion laws, especially during the first trimester of pregnancy. Recognizing that a number of problems appeared in New York, a shorter time period for &lsquo;unlimited&rsquo; abortions was advisable. The time period was bracketed to permit the various states to insert a figure more in keeping with the different conditions that might exist among the states. Likewise, the language limiting the place or places in which abortions may be performed was also bracketed to account for different conditions among the states. In addition, limitations on abortions after the initial &lsquo;unlimited&rsquo; period were placed in brackets so that individual states may adopt all or any of these reasons, or place further restrictions upon abortions after the initial period.&rdquo; This seems to be a fairly indirect influence of the New York law on the Supreme Court&rsquo;s decision.</span></p><p class="c8 c13"><span class="c4 c2"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c2">In the email correspondance with Jamie Harris, Rosemary Nossiff also noted that, &ldquo;[a]fter Roe, Missouri and Pennsylvania became the leading anti-abortion states.

Without imposing a standard of care, as the 1974 Pennsylvania act had, Missouri succeeded in gaining constitutional grounding for a definition of viability not bound by a trimester framework. This was significant, because it signaled the Supreme Court&rsquo;s later willingness to allow states to enact other restrictions on first-trimester abortions, such as prohibitng public funding of nontherapeutic abortions (</span><span class="c6 c2">Beal v.

On pages 5-7, Balmer argues that the biblical position on divorce&mdash;which evangelicals do not tend to take much issue with&mdash;is much less equivocal. Balmer describes the political engagement with abortion but not with divorce as &ldquo;selective literalism&rdquo; in the interpretation of the bible by evangelical leaders. He contrasts this with the Catholic Church, which also relies on &ldquo;the Bible as interpreted by church tradition and &lsquo;natural law&rsquo;&rdquo; for its doctrines. On pages 11-12, Balmer argues that this decision by evangelical leaders was made was because &ldquo;the issue of abortion has served the Religious Right very effectively for more than two decades. Although the Religious Right was slow to pick up on abortion as a political issue, it proved to be a potent one for them during the 1980s, in part because Reagan championed the pro-life cause&hellip; In the 1980s, in order to solidify the shift from divorce to abortion, the Religious Right constructed an </span><span class="c6 c2">abortion myth</span><span class="c2">, one accepted by most Americans as true. Simply put, the abortion myth is this: Leaders of the Religious Right would have us believe that their movement began in direct response to the U.S. Supreme Court&rsquo;s 1973 </span><span class="c6 c2">Roe v. Wade </span><span class="c4 c2">decision. Politically conservative evangelical leaders were so morally outraged by the ruling that they instantly shed their apolitical stupid in order to mobilize politically in defense of the sanctity of life.&rdquo; However, Balmer argues that at the time, &ldquo;the vast majority of evangelical leaders said virtually nothing about it; many of those who did comment actually applauded the decision,&rdquo; and cites several examples of evangelical leaders offering support for abortion in at least some circumstances. On pages 13-17, Balmer explains that he attended a &ldquo;conference in Washington sponsored by the Ethics and Public Policy Center, a Religious Right organization.&rdquo; Several attendees agreed that the evangelical community had become politically active in response to challenges by the Internal Revenue Service against Christian schools. &ldquo;Paul M. Weyrich, a longtime conservative activist, head of what is now called the Free Congress Foundation, and one of the architects in the Religious Right in the late 1970s&rdquo; said that [in Balmer&rsquo;s words] &ldquo;evangelical leaders held a conference call to discuss strategy. He recalled that someone suggested that they had the makings of a broader political movement&mdash;something that Weyrich had been pushing for all along&mdash;and asked what issues they might address. Several callers made suggestions, and then, according to Weyrich, a voice on the end of one of the lines said, &lsquo;How about abortion?&rsquo; And that is how abortion was cobbled into the political agenda of the Religious Right.&rdquo; </span></p></div><div><p class="c8"><a href="#ftnt_ref652" id="ftnt652">[652]</a><span class="c2">&nbsp;Doan, </span><span class="c6 c2">Opposition &amp; Intimidation</span><span class="c4 c2">, 79 notes that &ldquo;The 1976 presidential campaign functioned as a catalyst for fundamentalists&rsquo; participation in politics.

The ideological, methodological, and theological differences were no longer contained between the two groups, and by the end of 1980 they felt an outright animosity toward each other. The internal conflict within the pro-life movement was publicly evidenced in the two conflicting pro-life bills introduced in Congress during 1982. The Helms Human Life Statute (the Helms bill) and the Hatch Human Life Federalism Amendment (the Hatch amendment) were being deliberated in Congress. The difference between the two pro-life amendments was the absolutist position taken in each bill. Helms&rsquo;s bill sought to overturn </span><span class="c6 c2">Roe </span><span class="c2">by imposing a federal statutory ban on all abortions, whereas the Hatch amendment proposed overriding </span><span class="c6 c2">Roe </span><span class="c4 c2">by returning abortion decisions to the states. The Hatch amendment was more moderate and was endorsed by the Catholic Conference of Bishops in 1981, who reasoned that Christians had an obligation &lsquo;to advocate the improvement of such laws at every stage of the legislative process.&rsquo; For absolutist proponents, the Hatch amendment was completely unacceptable, and they felt it simply highlighted the continued insignificance of the unborn because if the Hatch amendment passed, elective abortion services would remain legal in several states. Neither the Helms bill nor the Hatch amendment passed, representing a significant defeat for the pro-life movement, as well as underscoring the tension within the movement.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c8 c13"><span class="c4 c2"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c2">Doan, </span><span class="c6 c2">Opposition &amp; Intimidation</span><span class="c4 c2">, 84 adds that &ldquo;The Christian Right insisted on taking pure politician positions and refused to compromise, which is very limiting and problematic when operating in an institutional system premised on political compromise.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c8 c13"><span class="c4 c2"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c4 c2">However, Cassidy, &ldquo;The Right to Life Movement,&rdquo; 145 argues that during this period, &ldquo;the Catholic bishops and their supporters favored a states-rights approach, but so did the evangelicals and fundamentalists of the Christian Right.

On page 513, Williams summarizes that &ldquo;When the Republican national convention convened in Kansas City in 1976, the party&rsquo;s pro-choice majority did not expect a significant challenge to their views on abortion. Public opinion polls showed that Republican voters were, on average, more pro-choice than their Democratic counterparts, a view that the convention delegates shared; fewer than 40 percent of the delegates considered themselves pro-life. The chair of the Republican National Committee, Mary Louise Smith, supported abortion rights, as did First Lady Betty Ford, who declared </span><span class="c6 c2">Roe v. Wade</span><span class="c4 c2">&nbsp;a &ldquo;great, great decision.&rdquo; Likewise, Vice President Nelson Rockefeller, who had taken a leading role in the fight for abortion rights in New York in the late 1960s and early 1970s, was solidly pro-choice. Even some of the party&rsquo;s conservatives, such as Senator Barry Goldwater, supported abortion rights. But in spite of the Republican Party&rsquo;s pro-choice leadership, the GOP adopted a platform in 1976 that promised an antiabortion constitutional amendment. The party&rsquo;s leadership viewed the measure as a temporary political ploy that would increase the GOP&rsquo;s appeal among traditionally Democratic Catholics, but the platform statement instead became a rallying cry for social conservatives who used the plank to build a religiously based coalition in the GOP and drive out many of the pro-choice Republicans who had initially adopted the platform.

No Republican who refused to support the pro-life movement was able to gain the party&rsquo;s nomination for president. In 1996, when Republican presidential nominee Bob Dole suggested modifications in the party&rsquo;s platform statement on abortion to soften the position that he had helped to create twenty years earlier, Christian Right leaders and pro-life activists overruled the nominee&rsquo;s wishes and insisted that the party retain its support for a &ldquo;human life&rdquo; amendment. The party&rsquo;s official position against abortion had become the symbol for a culturally conservative movement that was more powerful than Republican Party leaders, and even the ones who had created the party platform statement were unable to reverse it&hellip; the conservative Catholics and evangelicals who joined the GOP viewed the party&rsquo;s stance on abortion as a symbol of the party&rsquo;s values and a sign that their agenda would find a welcome home in a party whose leadership had once been the preserve of Episcopalians and other mainline Protestants.&rdquo;</span></p></div><div><p class="c8"><a href="#ftnt_ref672" id="ftnt672">[672]</a><span class="c4 c2">&nbsp;See, for example, footnote 651.</span></p></div><div><p class="c8"><a href="#ftnt_ref673" id="ftnt673">[673]</a><span class="c2">&nbsp;For relevant statistics, see the footnotes to the first paragraph in this section on &ldquo;Association with the Republican party.&rdquo; For discussion of this point, see Greg D.

Abortion rights advocates such as the National Organization for Women (NOW) and the National Association for the Repeal of Abortion Laws (NARAL) did not stop at advocating abortion rights in emergency health situations, as the abortion law liberalization movement had done, but instead called for legalizing &ldquo;abortion-on-demand&rdquo; in the belief that no woman should be forced to carry an unwanted pregnancy to term. As a consequence, the abortion rights movement moved away from its early association with Protestant-led birth-control campaigns, and became associated primarily with the feminist movement and the sexual revolution, both of which were disconcerting to many socially conservative Republican Protestants.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c8 c13"><span class="c4 c2"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c2">For detail and supporting evidence on these claims, see the section on &ldquo;</span><span class="c7 c2"><a class="c14" href="#h.tyjcwt">Early History of the Movement</a></span><span class="c2">&rdquo; in &ldquo;</span><span class="c7 c2"><a class="c14" href="#h.2et92p0">A Condensed Chronological History of the Anti-Abortion Movement</a></span><span class="c4 c2">.&rdquo;</span></p></div><div><p class="c8"><a href="#ftnt_ref681" id="ftnt681">[681]</a><span class="c2">&nbsp;Williams, </span><span class="c6 c2">Defenders of the Unborn</span><span class="c4 c2">, 215-6 argues that, &ldquo;[b]y defining &lsquo;pro-life&rsquo; as being in support of the HLA, the NRLC and other pro-life organizations effectively redefined the movement and alienated some liberal supporters. Although the pro-life movement was still thoroughly bipartisan in the mid-1970s, with large numbers of both Republicans and Democrats in the movement, pro-life liberal Democratic politicians were more likely than pro-life Republicans to oppose the HLA and to emphasize solutions that reduced the abortion rate, rather than simply making abortion illegal.&rdquo; On page 220, Williams adds that, &ldquo;because of the increasingly strong influence of the feminist movement, it would have been political suicide for a Democratic presidential candidate to endorse a constitutional amendment that would ahve banned abortion nationwide.

This is the most straightforward measure available. Yet it is biased in an important way. Rapoport and Stone assume that all change among the portion of the population that is replaced from one period to the next is caused by turnover. In some instances this assumption is not reasonable.&rdquo; On pages 79-81, Karol uses this formula and finds that &ldquo;60 percent of the change in the mean position for the Democratic caucus stemmed from conversion. For the Republicans, however, the net conversion effect was only 28 percent, which suggests that although change among continuing GOP MCs [Republican members of Congress] was important, it was a secondary factor in explaining the repositioning of their party on abortion. The combined total effect of conversion, just under 45%, is far greater than the literature leads us to expect, and given the conservatism of the Rapoport and Stone measure it suggests that more than half of the change was probably caused by conversion.&rdquo;</span></p></div><div><p class="c8"><a href="#ftnt_ref683" id="ftnt683">[683]</a><span class="c2">&nbsp;Geoffrey C.

Several authors have also reported that attachment was not increased by knowledge of fetal sex (Grace, 1984; Wu &amp; Eichmann, 1983) nor being able to see the ultrasound monitor (Reading et al., 1984). All prospective studies have reported a significant linear increase in attachment regardless of technological intervention.
