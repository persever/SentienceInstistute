<meta name="citation_abstract" content="Whether the Supreme Court of the United States drives or is driven by social change is an important strategic question for social movements that seek to implement systemic change in the United States.

Although the question has been considered for centuries,</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt1" id="ftnt_ref1">[1]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;relevant empirical academic research has only begun more recently, arguably since Dahl (1957).</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt2" id="ftnt_ref2">[2]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;Work by Ammori (2006) at the Information Society Project provides a synthesis of this literature focused on free speech and argues that there is some association between</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Supreme Court </span><span class="c3">decisions and public opinion, but there is both more recent data available since 2006 and a gap in weighing the evidence of effects in both directions.</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt3" id="ftnt_ref3">[3]</a></sup><span class="c5 c3">&nbsp;This report addresses that gap, seeking to provide a summary that is understandable and actionable for advocates in social movements, especially the contemporary farmed animal movement.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c5 c3"></span></p><p class="c10 c18"><span class="c3">Past work done by Sentience Institute has argued that the farmed animal movement needs to redistribute resources from &ldquo;tactics that work by convincing individuals one-by-one to change their consumption&rdquo; to &ldquo;tactics that focus on changing institutions: governments, companies, nonprofits, and society as a whole.&rdquo;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt4" id="ftnt_ref4">[4]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;Influencing the decision-making of the courts, of which the Supreme Court is the highest and most influential in the US, is a promising institutional tactic.</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt5" id="ftnt_ref5">[5]</a></sup><span class="c5 c3">&nbsp;Better understanding the effects of Supreme Court decisions and the influences upon those decisions will help to evaluate the extent to which the farmed animal movement should prioritize this tactic.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c5 c3"></span></p><p class="c10 c18"><span class="c3">Sentience Institute&rsquo;s historical research currently focuses on social movements that are most comparable to the farmed animal movement and on technology adoptions that present the most useful comparisons to animal-free food technology.</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt6" id="ftnt_ref6">[6]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;Although evidence from other, less comparable social movements and technologies usually provides weaker evidence for the foundational questions in effective animal advocacy, some issues of relevance to these questions have already been researched thoroughly across multiple historical contexts; summarizing this research can provide a greater breadth of evidence on specific questions than can be provided by a small number of case studies. The question of whether the Supreme Court drives or is driven by social change is one such topic. This research provides evidence for the questions of whether animal advocates should focus on changing individuals or changing institutions and social norms, influencers or the general population, and incremental institutional reform or radical, single-step institutional reform.</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt7" id="ftnt_ref7">[7]</a></sup></p><h1 class="c53 c18" id="h.ns31rfvv5k2i"><span class="c5 c25 c17">Methodology</span></h1><h2 class="c23 c18" id="h.eb9u8nikaqmt"><span>Research questions</span></h2><p class="c10 c18"><span class="c3">The findings of this literature review are organized by the questions listed below.</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt8" id="ftnt_ref8">[8]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;The wording and focus of the questions was informed by the content of the reviewed research and by the need for clarity for advocates who might use this report to drive social change.

The size of each of these effects is not clear enough to enable a rigorous evaluation of the cost-effectiveness of these different methods for achieving favorable Supreme Court rulings. If I had to guess, I would expect that advocacy efforts most directly targeted at Supreme Court cases, such as direct litigation and the submission of amicus curiae briefs, would be the most cost-effective methods of influencing any individual Supreme Court case.

This suggests that litigation for radical legal change can disrupt the status quo, but social movements should be prepared to respond to any unintended negative consequences. If movements are not yet prepared to deal with legislative backlash, then it may be preferable to delay active efforts to pursue radical legal change.

For example, the &ldquo;structural response&rdquo; model suggests that (controversial) Supreme Court decisions will have no overall effect on public opinion but will polarize different groups. At other times, models of change are subdivided beyond what is useful or necessary for the purposes of this literature review. For example, Thomas R.

I made only minor deviations from my plan. I made the following deviations and no others, that I can recall:</span></p><ul class="c22 lst-kix_oj9o7yni45w5-0 start"><li class="c0 c33"><span class="c4">I had initially planned to systematically search through both Google and Google Scholar for each of the search terms listed with the addition of the term &ldquo;literature review.&rdquo; However, when conducting the systematic search for &ldquo;Supreme Court&rdquo; &ldquo;public opinion&rdquo; &ldquo;literature review,&rdquo; I found that the results were unhelpful; it seemed to be disproportionately undergraduate research and other non-peer reviewed research that used the term &ldquo;literature review&rdquo; explicitly. To save time and avoid focusing on lower quality research, I decided to conduct the other searches that incorporated the term &ldquo;literature review&rdquo; non-systematically and to focus on Google Scholar but not Google.</span></li><li class="c0 c33"><span class="c4">Since the Google search was not very useful, I added to my inclusion criteria the consideration of whether items were published in a peer-reviewed academic journal.</span></li><li class="c0 c33"><span class="c4">For the final search term, &ldquo;Supreme Court&rdquo; (polarization OR polarisation OR polarizing OR polarising OR polarize OR polarise), I had originally listed only &ldquo;&ldquo;Supreme Court&rdquo; polarization,&rdquo; but realized that this might exclude some relevant research.</span></li><li class="c0 c33"><span class="c4">Though I did not initially write up my full list of inclusion criteria, I wrote these down early in the process, as I realized that I was using these criteria consistently but had not been explicit about them.</span></li><li class="c0 c33"><span class="c15">I realized that my search terms were frequently returning </span><span class="c17">research items </span><span class="c15">that focused on &ldquo;diffuse support&rdquo; for the Supreme Court, which was of little relevance to the research questions of this literature review. Therefore, after including a small number of such </span><span class="c17">items</span><span class="c15">, I began to exclude </span><span class="c17">items </span><span class="c15">that focus on the levels of &ldquo;diffuse support&rdquo; for the Supreme Court as an institution; this relates to the second inclusion criterion, but I had not planned to exclude such </span><span class="c17">items</span><span class="c4">, because I was not aware of this topic as a focus of existing research.</span></li><li class="c0 c33"><span class="c4">I made minor wording edits to the methodology for clarity, but did not otherwise change the substance of the process beyond the changes listed above.</span></li></ul></div><div><p class="c0"><a href="#ftnt_ref12" id="ftnt12">[12]</a><span class="c17">&nbsp;Given the novel methodology used in this report, the first person is used frequently to help clarify where the author of this report (Jamie Harris, researcher at Sentience Institute) has made judgment calls that some readers may disagree with.</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0 c14"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">For the first search term, I used the same methodology again with the standard Google search engine. For each of the other listed search terms, I first conducted a non-systematic search of Google Scholar, adding the phrase &ldquo;literature review&rdquo; to the search term (1 of the 121 included items was identified this way).</span></p></div><div><p class="c0"><a href="#ftnt_ref13" id="ftnt13">[13]</a><span class="c4">&nbsp;In my scoring, I also attempted to ignore, as far as possible, prior theoretical beliefs of heuristics. That is, I treated the default score for a research item as 0, even if, without having conducted this literature review I would estimate the probability that the answer to the question is &ldquo;yes&rdquo; as something other than 50%.</span></p><p class="c0 c14"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15">As far as possible, to avoid double counting evidence, I scored the research independently of other research findings. For example, if one </span><span class="c17">research item </span><span class="c15">used methods that I found persuasive but that were subsequently critiqued in a second </span><span class="c17">item</span><span class="c15">, I might give the first </span><span class="c17">item </span><span class="c15">a score of +4 and then the second </span><span class="c17">item </span><span class="c15">a score of -2, rather than giving the initial </span><span class="c17">item </span><span class="c15">a score of +2. Relatedly, if two research </span><span class="c17">items </span><span class="c15">contained duplicate information or reached similar conclusions by using similar methods and data, I only scored this information once. This means that some </span><span class="c17">items </span><span class="c15">may appear to the reader to have counterintuitively high scores; this may be because I read that </span><span class="c17">item </span><span class="c15">before other similar </span><span class="c17">items </span><span class="c4">and therefore allocated it several points. </span></p><p class="c0 c14"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15">For example, I gave Thomas M.

Collins used logistic regression with several control variables to attempt to isolate the &ldquo;marginal impact&rdquo; of each independent variable on the probability of petitioner success. These results are used to predict probabilities of petitioner success with differing numbers of amicus briefs supporting the petitioner or the respondent. Collins does not note the 1.8% figure explicitly. Collins&rsquo; results suggest that, &ldquo;holding all other variables at their mean or modal values,&rdquo; the petitioner&rsquo;s probability of success is 71.8% with no amicus briefs supporting the petitioner and no amicus briefs supporting the respondent. This increases to 73.6% chance of a petitioner win with 1 supporting amicus brief but no opposing amicus briefs (i.e. a difference of 1.8% from 0 briefs), 75.4% with 2 supporting amicus briefs (i.e. a further difference of 1.8 from 1 brief), and 77.1% with 3 supporting amicus briefs (i.e. a further difference of 1.7% </span><span class="c17">f</span><span class="c4">rom 2 briefs). Rounded to 1 decimal place, this suggests that each of the first three additional unopposed amicus briefs supporting the petitioner is associated with an average of a 1.8% higher chance of petitioner success. A similar calculation using Collins&rsquo; results suggests that each of the first few unopposed amicus briefs supporting the respondent decreased the chances of petitioner success by about 2.4%.</span></p><p class="c0 c14"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15">Joseph D.

The effort backfired when activists and the public focused on projected casualty numbers included in the report (e.g. 3,400 deaths and upwards of 40,000 injuries in one scenario). Additionally, public debates tend not to focus on a specific chain of well-established technical claims (which is often necessary for arguing why a given technology is safe) but instead glide from concern to concern: &lsquo;As the opposition [to nuclear power] developed, its basis broadened out to reveal successive layers or facets of concern.

On page 213, Klarman notes that, &ldquo;[i]n state after state, voters have rejected gay marriage when they probably would have approved civil unions if given the opportunity. In 2009, Mainers rejected gay marriage by 53 percent to 47 percent, while polls showed that they favored either gay marriage or civil unions over no legal recognition for same-sex couples by 73.8 percent to 23 percent.
