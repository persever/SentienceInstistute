companies should do when they encounter technical problems and cost overruns, particularly when scaling production. Near the end of the 20</span><span class="c13">th</span><span>&nbsp;century, work to produce fossil fuel equivalents like biodiesel using microorganisms and chemical reactions on renewable substrates like corn and cellulose intensified. Ethanol from corn had been manufactured in the US from the 1970s, but the 1990s through the 2010s saw waves of new biofuel production processes, eventually divided into second, third, and fourth generation biofuels. These generations promised to derive fuel from inedible matter like cellulose rather than edible matter like corn. They also promised higher efficiency, lower costs, improved sustainability, and ease of use. From the mid-2000s to about 2013, biofuels were increasingly seen as a solution to oil shortages and rising carbon emissions. Investment flooded in. By the mid-2010s, enthusiasm and investment had drained away in the face of repeated failures. Talk of fixing the world energy system was replaced by talk of a biofuel winter. The rise and fall of advanced biofuel firms remains one of the most-discussed failures of a sustainability technology. Cultured </span><span>meat</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;advocates and firms should consider what realistic rearguard action would look like in various bad-case scenarios in which affordable cultured meat takes one to four decades longer than any firm has predicted. Answers to these questions could help mitigate bad-case scenarios. To illustrate the potential impact with some high-level estimates, effective mitigation could mean the difference between, e.g., a 40-year delay in cultured meat adoption (in the event of large overreach, investor flight, and resulting cell-ag winter) and a 15-year delay in cultured meat adoption (in the event that scaling is harder than most firms thought, but a more careful and distributed strategy remains resilient against industry collapse). We estimate the difference between these two scenarios in years of farmed animal suffering to be in the high tens of trillions to low hundred trillions.</span></p><p class="c7"><span>This paper examines the </span><span class="c5"><a class="c4" href="#h.wkzfpge7zjay">histories</a></span><span>&nbsp;of four biofuel firms as proxies for wider trends within the industry.

Each of these firms offers a different set of lessons &nbsp;from which the cultured meat industry can learn. KiOR</span><sup><a href="#ftnt1" id="ftnt_ref1">[1]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;is notable for its sharp rise in prominence, inability to realize its technological promise, and rapid decline. Amyris also ran into technical trouble, but managed to stay alive by pivoting to smaller-scale, higher-margin products like cosmetics. Renewable Energy Group (REG) uses a more conservative approach than KiOR or Amyris and remains the largest biodiesel producer in the United States in part because of this approach. Unlike KiOR, Amyris, or REG, Novozymes has not built an end-to-end business model in which a fuel is derived from feedstock and sold to consumers. Instead, Novozymes develops and sells enzymes used in fuel production (among other applications), often to biofuel firms. Novozymes&rsquo; lack of interest in producing biofuels in a vertically-integrated way has, somewhat counterintuitively, contributed to the development of enzyme-based fuel production. The achievements and missteps of these firms suggest </span><span>different </span><span class="c3">paths and pitfalls for cultured meat projects.</span></p><h2 class="c19" id="h.dipinu2u5kwr"><span class="c0">KiOR</span></h2><h3 class="c24" id="h.eodhe4c9gmyr"><span class="c16">The technical failure of catalytic pyrolysis</span></h3><p class="c7"><span>In the second week of November 2014, the biofuel company KiOR filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in Delaware. From 2008 to 2011, KiOR had been widely regarded as one of the most promising firms working on next-generation biofuels.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt2" id="ftnt_ref2">[2]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;KiOR proposed to use catalytic pyrolysis to transform biomass feedstock into hydrocarbons to be used as fuel. What would become KiOR&rsquo;s largest plant, in Columbus, Mississippi, used woodchips as feedstock. The aim, as with many second- and third-generation biofuel ventures, was to produce useful fuel not from edible feedstock like corn, but from the cellulose in waste products like woodchips and cornstalk. Using inedible waste as feedstock </span><span>sidestepped </span><span>concerns that crops and land that would have produced food would instead be used to produce fuel.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt3" id="ftnt_ref3">[3]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;Second- and third-generation biofuel efforts also promised to reduce rather than increase total agricultural waste and to generate lower lifecycle carbon emissions when compared with conventional fossil fuels and first-generation biofuels from crops.</span></p><p class="c7"><span>KiOR&rsquo;s failure, although not unusual in an industry where setbacks have been common, </span><span>generally </span><span>arrived as a surprise. How could a publicly-traded company with ample funding, government-backed loans, and a large public offering fail to achieve even a fraction of its yield and cost targets? An unusual amount of information about KiOR&rsquo;s decline has entered the public record. The state of Mississippi sued KiOR for fraud, the SEC charged KiOR for withholding information about biofuel yields, a group of KiOR investors sued KiOR executives for misleading them, the company&rsquo;s Chapter 11 filing made thousands of internal documents public, and several highly-placed people in the firm, including those involved with the company&rsquo;s technology, have since spoken to trade publications like </span><span class="c14">Biofuels Digest</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;about their time at KiOR. The lawsuits have rendered a large amount of documentation public and the interviews with former executives and scientists have led to long, detailed articles about KiOR&rsquo;s ascent and implosion.</span></p><p class="c7"><span>KiOR&rsquo;s</span><span>&nbsp;first-choice strategy for converting biomass into usable hydrocarbons ran into early trouble. By the spring of 2008, lab results revealed &ldquo;excessive amounts of water, coke, gas and char and a relatively small amount of bio-oil that had a low acidity.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt4" id="ftnt_ref4">[4]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;Bio-oil was good, but high levels of water, coke, gas, and char were not. Their presence made it harder and less economical to upgrade the bio-oil into usable fuel. KiOR would have to find a way to reduce levels of undesirable material and to increase hydrocarbon output.</span></p><p class="c7"><span>Moreover, the proprietary catalyst used in the early tests was expensive. For KiOR to achieve its cost targets, its catalyst would have to be relatively cheap (at least in the low four figures of US dollars per metric ton) and its process would have to use limited amounts of catalyst. KiOR end</span><span>ed</span><span>&nbsp;up relying on ZSM-5 type catalysts, which are </span><span>quite expensive</span><span>&nbsp;(between six and eight thousand USD per metric ton).</span><sup><a href="#ftnt5" id="ftnt_ref5">[5]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;Weak results with an expensive catalyst were worrying, but not a death knell. It had always been essential to KiOR&rsquo;s business plan that costs would come down and yields rise as production scaled.</span></p><p class="c7"><span>A third and final problem arose as tests proceeded. KiOR researchers found that the yields from their pyrolysis were low, even with high-end catalysts. For KiOR to hit its cost and output targets, it would need to produce more than 60 gallons (~227 liters)</span><sup><a href="#ftnt6" id="ftnt_ref6">[6]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;of liquid hydrocarbons per ton (~907 kg) of dry biomass put in. In its initial public offering, KiOR estimated its yield at 67 gallons per bone-dry ton (BDT), with a yield target as high as 90 gallons/BDT at commercial scale.</span></p><p class="c7"><span>Most early tests found yields in the low 20 gallons/BDT range, and &ldquo;never above 30 gallons per bone dry ton of biomass,&rdquo; reported KiOR&rsquo;s science director, Conrad Zhang, in late 2008.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt7" id="ftnt_ref7">[7]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;KiOR tried repeatedly over the next four years to bring its yields into the 60-gallon/BDT range. The problem of low yields would precipitate several splits within the company over different technical approaches. On and off, internal splinter groups, convinced KiOR&rsquo;s main approach, biomass catalytic cracking (BCC),</span><sup><a href="#ftnt8" id="ftnt_ref8">[8]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;would never produce yields as high as the company needed, worked in quasi-secret on different technological approaches.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt9" id="ftnt_ref9">[9]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;They hoped to find some alternative process</span><sup><a href="#ftnt10" id="ftnt_ref10">[10]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;that would improve yields in a way that KiOR&rsquo;s BCC approach had not.</span></p><p class="c7"><span>These attempts failed. Yields never touched 60 gallons/BDT, costs never reached the promised $1.80 per gallon, and KiOR filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2014. </span></p><p class="c7"><span>This leads to an important strategic question: to what extent was this failure due to inherent technical challenges of biofuel production versus KiOR&rsquo;s own mistakes? </span><span>In his letter of resignation, KiOR board member Paul O&rsquo;Connor wrote: </span><span>&ldquo;The reason for [KiOR&rsquo;s difficulties], in my opinion, is not because of the failure of the technology itself, but because of several wrong choices made during the development and commercialization of the technology.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt11" id="ftnt_ref11">[11]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;In </span><span>truth</span><span class="c3">, technological shortcomings combined with decisions about how to develop and scale the technology led to failure. KiOR committed a variety of technical and strategic mistakes, particularly during the six crucial years from 2008 to 2013. These mistakes offer valuable lessons for contemporary firms attempting to move technologies from demonstration to commercialization. However, KiOR&rsquo;s catalytic pyrolysis process failed time and again to produce the results needed. The underlying fact is that positive technical results never appeared in time for KiOR to bring transport fuels to market.</span></p><p class="c7"><span>Almost all firms working on cultured meat will experience setbacks similar to KiOR&rsquo;s at some point. How these firms respond to technical difficulties will determine not only their success but in many cases the success of the technology in question. KiOR was unable to bridge the &ldquo;valley of death&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt12" id="ftnt_ref12">[12]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;between demonstration and commercialization. Cultured meat firms will have to learn from the failure of biofuel companies like KiOR to avoid vanishing into the same gap.</span></p><h3 class="c24" id="h.9mc262m3lkxn"><span>Strategic fixedness and overcommitment</span></h3><p class="c7"><span>KiOR&rsquo;s researchers and management team were probably less open to alternative technological approaches than they otherwise would have been because they felt pressured to bring products to market quickly. They were also constrained and confused by an inflexible management team prone to infighting. KiOR&rsquo;s &ldquo;strategy in rushing towards demonstrating the BCC technology at a multi-barrel-per-day scale,&rdquo; former Director of Technology Jacques De Deken wrote in 2008, &ldquo;without corroborating experimental data, under the pretense of self-deception of &lsquo;creating value</span><span>&rsquo;,</span><span>&nbsp;is a recipe for technical failure. Indeed, I do not believe that we currently have the experimental results, catalyst(s) or science base to justify the rush and expense of a [BCC] unit or demonstration... at this time.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt13" id="ftnt_ref13">[13]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;As early as 2008, KiOR was overcommitted to one approach, moving too hastily in part because of investor pressure, and unwilling or unable to explore alternative solutions.</span></p><p class="c7"><span>By 2010, KiOR&rsquo;s troubles had deepened. Yields remained low and its biocrude remained acidic and highly oxygenated. In response, KiOR management began to shut out employees critical of the technological approaches favored within the firm. For example, KiOR, when constructing their demo plant in 2010, kept Robert Bartek, De Deken&rsquo;s successor in overseeing plant design and testing, out of the design loop. While the plant&rsquo;s development might have run more smoothly in the short term without Bartek identifying problems, the decision eventually led to delays and cost overruns in the demo unit, including having to replace the unit&rsquo;s main reactor with a different design, an astonishing and costly error.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt14" id="ftnt_ref14">[14]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;Bartek left KiOR soon after, further weakening the company&rsquo;s ability to self-correct.</span></p><p class="c7"><span>Industry reporter Jim Lane describes these failures on KiOR&rsquo;s (and other biofuel firms&rsquo;) part as of a piece with the institutional errors made at NASA in the Space Shuttle era. &ldquo;The NASA cautionary tale is instructive,&rdquo; he writes, because &ldquo;there are correlations between KiOR and [the] </span><span class="c14">Columbia </span><span>[and </span><span class="c14">Challenger </span><span>disasters</span><span>]&hellip; Specifically, reluctance to test to understand why systems were not performing in accordance with requirements, organizational barriers that prevented effective communication of critical information and stifled professional differences of opinion; lack of integrated management across program elements; and the evolution of an informal chain of command and decision-making processes that operated outside the organization&rsquo;s rules.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt15" id="ftnt_ref15">[15]</a></sup></p><p class="c7"><span>One way of promoting institutional structures that can self-correct is to bring engineers into decision-making processes otherwise controlled by non-technical management and investors. For example, in January 2011, Dennis Stamires, a senior scientist at KiOR, wrote </span><span>in an email </span><span>that his team was &ldquo;still looking for a suitable catalyst, hopefully without containing ZSM, or at least a small portion. You can see how frustrated I am , after two or three years and all the work we have done, millions of dollars spent , we are now stuck in a Hole with the ZSM.&rdquo; </span><span>That same month</span><span>, however, &ldquo;in management circles, there wasn&rsquo;t a corresponding sense of gloom. In fact, there was a celebration going.&rdquo; KiOR had taken an important step toward securing a federal loan guarantee, and the management team, which was more concerned with financing than with engineering problems, remained less informed and concerned about technical questions than they should have been.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt16" id="ftnt_ref16">[16]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;This continued gap between researchers and engineers&rsquo; knowledge and the expectations of KiOR management hampered the company&rsquo;s ability to self-correct.</span></p><p class="c7"><span>High levels of stress and fear can stem from technical setbacks, which can further paralyze a firm&rsquo;s ability to respond. By late 2011, the firm had grown to 160 employees, but KiOR&rsquo;s low yields seemed as intractable as management&#39;s inability to think clearly about them. </span><span>At this time, &ldquo;[a] KiOR insider... described... a</span><span>&nbsp;&lsquo;fearful working atmosphere&rsquo;.... For employees &lsquo;to survive and keep their jobs, and not being isolate [</span><span class="c14">sic</span><span>]</span><span>&nbsp;or fired, they had to remain silent and accept the &lsquo;party-line&rsquo; involving the fraudulent and deceiving information fed to the public and investors.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt17" id="ftnt_ref17">[17]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;Of course, fraud and deceit were not necessary for KiOR to continue to work on the technical problem of low yields.</span></p><p class="c7"><span>It could be suggested that if deceiving investors were to have lengthened KiOR&rsquo;s runway and this lengthened runway had contributed to solving the technical problems they faced, deception </span><span>would </span><span>have to be evaluated as a net positive for the technology&rsquo;s sake if nothing else. However, KiOR&rsquo;s attempts to hide its technical struggles stemmed from panic and paralysis</span><span>&nbsp;rather than from long-term strategy</span><span class="c3">. This same culture of fear fueled KiOR&rsquo;s inflexibility toward different technical approaches and their hesitance to perform engineering due diligence that would have given researchers the data they needed to discern which approaches and designs would work and which would not. KiOR&rsquo;s paralyzed response in the face of technical setbacks is evident in the firm&rsquo;s strategy of refusing to openly acknowledge adverse results, which damaged its ability to explore and fix the technical problems underlying these results.</span></p><p class="c7"><span>Investor pressure affected KiOR in a number of ways. In particular, it tended to decrease the firm&rsquo;s likelihood of conducting engineering due diligence. For example, in the second half of 2008, KiOR was testing different materials and reactor designs for their pyrolytic process. Several researchers argued for conducting a variety of baseline tests to better isolate the effect changes in materials and design would have on later tests.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt18" id="ftnt_ref18">[18]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;These tests, according to one employee, were not particularly difficult, but would take money and time.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt19" id="ftnt_ref19">[19]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;However, Paul O&rsquo;Connor (who would later criticize KiOR management for making decisions like these), CTO at the time, wrote a memo to all staff in September 2008 in which he &ldquo;objected doing any calibration to establish a baseline,&rdquo; effectively killing the effort to do so.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt20" id="ftnt_ref20">[20]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;Lane reports that O&rsquo;Connor&rsquo;s &ldquo;reasoning is not clear,&rdquo; but guesses that &ldquo;costs and&hellip; timelines, based on KiOR&rsquo;s timelines to scale and available cash,&rdquo; played a role. These costs and timelines were, of course, driven by KiOR&rsquo;s venture capital funders. As KiOR&rsquo;s problems deepened, its main investor, Khosla Ventures, bec</span><span>a</span><span class="c3">me more involved in the firm&rsquo;s decision-making.</span></p><p class="c7"><span>KiOR&rsquo;s &ldquo;modus operandi was &lsquo;Reckless rush to Commercial,&rsquo;&rdquo; recalled </span><span>senior scientist Dennis </span><span>Stamires.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt21" id="ftnt_ref21">[21]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;According to Stamires, KiOR&rsquo;s haste to commercialize was spurred by venture capital investment. The firm had accepted large investments from biofuel enthusiast and venture capitalist Vinod Khosla, who took an active interest in the firm&rsquo;s decisions and development timelines. &ldquo;Khosla and [Samir] Kaul made the important decisions,&rdquo; Stamires reported, &ldquo;while Ditsch and Cannon simply executed the orders. And Ditsch, Hacskaylo, Artzer, and Cannon set the [day-to-day] policies, and communicated with the public and investors. The rest of the management team were kept in the dark.&rdquo; Andre Ditsch, Fred Cannon, John Hacskaylo, and Chris Artzer were all KiOR upper management, whereas Vinod Khosla and Samir Kaul worked at Khosla Ventures. </span><span>The active involvement of investors in KiOR&rsquo;s management generated a further split in the company. It meant that when KiOR&rsquo;s technological development started to run into roadblocks, actors in the company strove to obscure its difficulties not only from the public, but also from other employees in the firm. The involvement of investors and the split between managers who carried out their orders and managers who were kept in dark &ldquo;created confusion, poor morale, fear, discord, and mismanagement&rdquo; at KiOR.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt22" id="ftnt_ref22">[22]</a></sup></p><p class="c7"><span>In January 2012, Stamires began his efforts to save KiOR by retooling the firm&rsquo;s technological approach. He quit the management team and &ldquo;</span><span class="c25 c22">notified the CEO, Fred Cannon, that </span><span>[he] </span><span class="c25 c22">would devote</span><span>&hellip; [his] </span><span class="c25 c22">time and available resources to developing a new, economically feasible technology capable of meeting KiOR&rsquo;s business objectives.&rdquo;</span><sup class="c25 c22"><a href="#ftnt23" id="ftnt_ref23">[23]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;Stamires &ldquo;</span><span>requested the formation of a task force, called &lsquo;Project Team Oil Yield&rsquo;, operating separately from Hacskaylo&rsquo; R">&nbsp;Ibid.</span></p></div></body></html>
