Beginning in the 1970s, France underwent far-reaching energy nuclearization. The country went from drawing over half of its power from oil-burning plants in the early 1970s to drawing 75% of its electricity from nuclear plants by 1990.</span><sup class="c13"><a href="#ftnt1" id="ftnt_ref1">[1]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;Every other high-income country failed to undergo similar levels of nuclearization. In the United States, nuclear power has never exceeded 21% of electricity generation. Nuclear power and its uptake maps one future possibility space for clean meat (also known as cultured meat, i.e. meat grown from animal cells outside of animal bodies): a nascent technology, developed in laboratories for decades, must transition into the technology stack used to produce electricity or food for the general public and in large institutional settings</span><span>.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Many studies in the area of clean meat adoption have focused on consumer acceptance.</span><sup class="c13"><a href="#ftnt2" id="ftnt_ref2">[2]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;Relying on consumer choice (i.e. individuals choosing to buy products associated with the new technology, such as at a grocery store or restaurant) as a method of social or technical change, however, has shortcomings.</span><sup class="c13"><a href="#ftnt3" id="ftnt_ref3">[3]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;Though consumer acceptance or resistance is almost certain to play a role in the adoption of clean meat, institutional uptake (e.g. institutions like college cafeterias and ready-to-eat meal producers switching their supply chain to the new technology) remains an understudied phenomenon that </span><span>accounts for a significant amount of food production and can itself hasten or delay consumer acceptance, such as by accustoming consumers to the new technology</span><span class="c4">.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>In the case of animal-free meat,</span><sup><a href="#ftnt4" id="ftnt_ref4">[4]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;accelerating widespread adoption by one year could avoid the killing of approximately 907 billion animals. The </span><span>U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization estimates that 56 billion </span><span>farmed land animals</span><span>&nbsp;are killed every year for human consumption. Mood and Brooke estimate that between 37 and 120 billion farmed fish and between 970 and 2,700 billion wild fish are killed yearly. An additional 448 to 1,025 billion fish are used to produce fishmeal and fish oil (mostly for aquaculture feed). Using the most conservative estimates available and assuming a 60% reduction in deaths brought about by animal-free meat indicates that 906.6 billion animal deaths would be averted by clean meat in one year. Assuming middle-range numbers and a 90% reduction from clean meat suggests that 2.44 trillion animal lives would be spared per year. (These estimates do not include bait fish, bycatch, or illegal and unreported catch and are therefore probably undercounts.)</span><sup class="c13"><a href="#ftnt5" id="ftnt_ref5">[5]</a></sup></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Clean meat could function as a substitute good for animal protein in the industrial-scale supply chains that feed schools, hospitals, militaries, refugee camps, large corporations, and provide foreign food aid. The institutional uptake of clean meat could avert a large amount of animal suffering while establishing the infrastructural groundwork for food-production supply chains that do not depend upon animal farming.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Studying how the institutional uptake of emergent technologies occurs, therefore, is relatively important and relatively neglected for those who aim to facilitate the adoption of clean meat to reduce animal meat consumption.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Overall, this report provides evidence for the following claims:</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><ul class="c20 lst-kix_ld78dcawe6ra-0 start"><li class="c0 c6"><span class="c4">Reductions in the supply of a good tend to raise prices for that good and open a critical window for the adoption of a competitive good. Nuclear energy benefited from this dynamic when oil was subject to price shocks in the 1970s. Clean meat adoption could be accelerated by supply shocks for animal products.</span></li></ul><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><ul class="c20 lst-kix_ld78dcawe6ra-0"><li class="c0 c6"><span class="c4">Some factors that influence the available supply of a good, like weather events, are out the control of activists and advocates. Others, like regulation, can be influenced by focused campaigns. Focusing on regulation, corporate campaigns, welfare improvements, labor activism, supply chain disruption, and other factors that can constrict the supply of a target good is an effective way of increasing the price of that good, decreasing quantity consumed, and accelerating the adoption of replacement goods like clean meat.</span></li></ul><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><ul class="c20 lst-kix_ld78dcawe6ra-0"><li class="c0 c6"><span>Different types of supply shocks have different dimensions that can make them more or less potent. Activist campaigns should be attentive to how fears over food supply reliability evoke national security concerns, how </span><span class="c3">E. coli</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;or bovine spongiform encephalopathy recalls heighten public worry about the uncleanliness of factory-farmed meat, and how extreme weather events both threaten food supply chains and bring the connection between climate change and animal farming to the fore.</span></li></ul><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><ul class="c20 lst-kix_ld78dcawe6ra-0"><li class="c0 c6"><span class="c4">There are good reasons to be cautious of relying on technically-informed, scientifically-sound explanations for why clean meat is safe to shift public sentiment in a positive direction. Public discourse tends to be both mercurial and suspicious about technical arguments for the safety of a new technology. There is even evidence for a backlash effect in which increased discussion of technical safety issues, even if these discussions explain why a new product is safe, tends to increase rather than decrease negative sentiment around a new technology.</span></li></ul><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><ul class="c20 lst-kix_ld78dcawe6ra-0"><li class="c0 c6"><span class="c4">For an emerging technology, the tone and content of media coverage matters a great deal. There is evidence that positive or negative coverage is a leading rather than lagging indicator of public sentiment.</span></li></ul><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><ul class="c20 lst-kix_ld78dcawe6ra-0"><li class="c0 c6"><span class="c4">Clean meat developers should be especially wary of risking safety incidents that would confirm or appear to confirm preexisting concerns or narratives about clean meat. This dynamic was especially damaging to nuclear power.</span></li></ul><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><ul class="c20 lst-kix_ld78dcawe6ra-0"><li class="c0 c6"><span class="c4">Government centralization and technocracy shape the adoption of new technologies. For example, a closed, highly centralized decision-making process is generally better able to insulate itself from opposition, especially site-specific opposition, than is a relatively open, decentralized process. Perceptions among high-level bureaucrats about the way a new technology complements or conflicts with their vision of the state also influences institutional adoption. Because utility-scale power is regulated, built, and purchased differently from food products, it is hard to know how these factors will affect the adoption of clean meat.</span></li></ul><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><ul class="c20 lst-kix_ld78dcawe6ra-0"><li class="c0 c6"><span>Technically-adept states that depend on food imports are likely to be more receptive to the institutional adoption of clean meat than states that do not have these characteristics. So far, most clean meat companies have focused on the US market. States like Singapore remain underrated as potential early adopters of clean meat.</span></li></ul><p class="c1 c36"><span class="c30 c9"></span></p><h1 class="c32 c25" id="h.qutkn963h7u3"><span class="c15 c26">Why did France adopt nuclear power?</span></h1><p class="c0"><span>Starting in the mid-1950s, the possibility of using nuclear fission to generate power transitioned from laboratories in the United States and the Soviet Union to power-producing public works projects.
