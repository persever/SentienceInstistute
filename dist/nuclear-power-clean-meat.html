Beginning in the 1970s, France underwent far-reaching energy nuclearization. The country went from drawing over half of its power from oil-burning plants in the early 1970s to drawing 75% of its electricity from nuclear plants by 1990.</span><sup class="c13"><a href="#ftnt1" id="ftnt_ref1">[1]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;Every other high-income country failed to undergo similar levels of nuclearization. In the United States, nuclear power has never exceeded 21% of electricity generation. Nuclear power and its uptake maps one future possibility space for clean meat (also known as cultured meat, i.e. meat grown from animal cells outside of animal bodies): a nascent technology, developed in laboratories for decades, must transition into the technology stack used to produce electricity or food for the general public and in large institutional settings</span><span>.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Many studies in the area of clean meat adoption have focused on consumer acceptance.</span><sup class="c13"><a href="#ftnt2" id="ftnt_ref2">[2]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;Relying on consumer choice (i.e. individuals choosing to buy products associated with the new technology, such as at a grocery store or restaurant) as a method of social or technical change, however, has shortcomings.</span><sup class="c13"><a href="#ftnt3" id="ftnt_ref3">[3]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;Though consumer acceptance or resistance is almost certain to play a role in the adoption of clean meat, institutional uptake (e.g. institutions like college cafeterias and ready-to-eat meal producers switching their supply chain to the new technology) remains an understudied phenomenon that </span><span>accounts for a significant amount of food production and can itself hasten or delay consumer acceptance, such as by accustoming consumers to the new technology</span><span class="c4">.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>In the case of animal-free meat,</span><sup><a href="#ftnt4" id="ftnt_ref4">[4]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;accelerating widespread adoption by one year could avoid the killing of approximately 907 billion animals. The </span><span>U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization estimates that 56 billion </span><span>farmed land animals</span><span>&nbsp;are killed every year for human consumption. Mood and Brooke estimate that between 37 and 120 billion farmed fish and between 970 and 2,700 billion wild fish are killed yearly. An additional 448 to 1,025 billion fish are used to produce fishmeal and fish oil (mostly for aquaculture feed). Using the most conservative estimates available and assuming a 60% reduction in deaths brought about by animal-free meat indicates that 906.6 billion animal deaths would be averted by clean meat in one year. Assuming middle-range numbers and a 90% reduction from clean meat suggests that 2.44 trillion animal lives would be spared per year. (These estimates do not include bait fish, bycatch, or illegal and unreported catch and are therefore probably undercounts.)</span><sup class="c13"><a href="#ftnt5" id="ftnt_ref5">[5]</a></sup></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Clean meat could function as a substitute good for animal protein in the industrial-scale supply chains that feed schools, hospitals, militaries, refugee camps, large corporations, and provide foreign food aid. The institutional uptake of clean meat could avert a large amount of animal suffering while establishing the infrastructural groundwork for food-production supply chains that do not depend upon animal farming.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Studying how the institutional uptake of emergent technologies occurs, therefore, is relatively important and relatively neglected for those who aim to facilitate the adoption of clean meat to reduce animal meat consumption.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Overall, this report provides evidence for the following claims:</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><ul class="c20 lst-kix_ld78dcawe6ra-0 start"><li class="c0 c6"><span class="c4">Reductions in the supply of a good tend to raise prices for that good and open a critical window for the adoption of a competitive good. Nuclear energy benefited from this dynamic when oil was subject to price shocks in the 1970s. Clean meat adoption could be accelerated by supply shocks for animal products.</span></li></ul><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><ul class="c20 lst-kix_ld78dcawe6ra-0"><li class="c0 c6"><span class="c4">Some factors that influence the available supply of a good, like weather events, are out the control of activists and advocates. Others, like regulation, can be influenced by focused campaigns. Focusing on regulation, corporate campaigns, welfare improvements, labor activism, supply chain disruption, and other factors that can constrict the supply of a target good is an effective way of increasing the price of that good, decreasing quantity consumed, and accelerating the adoption of replacement goods like clean meat.</span></li></ul><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><ul class="c20 lst-kix_ld78dcawe6ra-0"><li class="c0 c6"><span>Different types of supply shocks have different dimensions that can make them more or less potent. Activist campaigns should be attentive to how fears over food supply reliability evoke national security concerns, how </span><span class="c3">E. coli</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;or bovine spongiform encephalopathy recalls heighten public worry about the uncleanliness of factory-farmed meat, and how extreme weather events both threaten food supply chains and bring the connection between climate change and animal farming to the fore.</span></li></ul><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><ul class="c20 lst-kix_ld78dcawe6ra-0"><li class="c0 c6"><span class="c4">There are good reasons to be cautious of relying on technically-informed, scientifically-sound explanations for why clean meat is safe to shift public sentiment in a positive direction. Public discourse tends to be both mercurial and suspicious about technical arguments for the safety of a new technology. There is even evidence for a backlash effect in which increased discussion of technical safety issues, even if these discussions explain why a new product is safe, tends to increase rather than decrease negative sentiment around a new technology.</span></li></ul><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><ul class="c20 lst-kix_ld78dcawe6ra-0"><li class="c0 c6"><span class="c4">For an emerging technology, the tone and content of media coverage matters a great deal. There is evidence that positive or negative coverage is a leading rather than lagging indicator of public sentiment.</span></li></ul><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><ul class="c20 lst-kix_ld78dcawe6ra-0"><li class="c0 c6"><span class="c4">Clean meat developers should be especially wary of risking safety incidents that would confirm or appear to confirm preexisting concerns or narratives about clean meat. This dynamic was especially damaging to nuclear power.</span></li></ul><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><ul class="c20 lst-kix_ld78dcawe6ra-0"><li class="c0 c6"><span class="c4">Government centralization and technocracy shape the adoption of new technologies. For example, a closed, highly centralized decision-making process is generally better able to insulate itself from opposition, especially site-specific opposition, than is a relatively open, decentralized process. Perceptions among high-level bureaucrats about the way a new technology complements or conflicts with their vision of the state also influences institutional adoption. Because utility-scale power is regulated, built, and purchased differently from food products, it is hard to know how these factors will affect the adoption of clean meat.</span></li></ul><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><ul class="c20 lst-kix_ld78dcawe6ra-0"><li class="c0 c6"><span>Technically-adept states that depend on food imports are likely to be more receptive to the institutional adoption of clean meat than states that do not have these characteristics. So far, most clean meat companies have focused on the US market. States like Singapore remain underrated as potential early adopters of clean meat.</span></li></ul><p class="c1 c36"><span class="c30 c9"></span></p><h1 class="c32 c25" id="h.qutkn963h7u3"><span class="c15 c26">Why did France adopt nuclear power?</span></h1><p class="c0"><span>Starting in the mid-1950s, the possibility of using nuclear fission to generate power transitioned from laboratories in the United States and the Soviet Union to power-producing public works projects.

Second, the moves that would be needed to support nuclear energy in the two countries were quite different. In France it was an elegant announcement releasing certain institutional energies. In the United States it would have been a complex scheme involving utility financing and rate relief for something called CWIP (construction work in progress), hardly the stuff of myth.

The 1973 oil shock is itself a famous example of the effects of the supply of a good being constrained. Expanding demand coupled with flat, declining, or slowly-rising supply is the traditional recipe for rapid increases in price. The idea of price shocks for food have been of continuing concern to economists. Take this 2010 USDA report on food commodity prices as an example: &ldquo;World market prices for major food commodities such as grain and vegetables have risen sharply to historic highs of more than 60 percent above levels just 2 years ago. Many factors have contributed to a tightening of world balances of grains and oilseeds over the last decade [including] increased demand for biofuels[,] feedstocks[,] and adverse weather conditions in 2006 and 2007 in some major grain- and oilseed-producing areas [as well as] rising energy prices [and] increasing agricultural costs of production.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt32" id="ftnt_ref32">[32]</a></sup><span class="c4">&nbsp;Clearly, a variety of different factors can generate supply constraints.

For example, in 1948, eight percent of Americans reported that they opposed &ldquo;the use of live animals in medical teaching and research.&rdquo; By 1999, 37.5% said that medical tests on animals were unacceptable.</span><sup class="c13"><a href="#ftnt40" id="ftnt_ref40">[40]</a></sup></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Two factors may explain this resistance: a general expansion of humanity&rsquo;s moral circle</span><sup><a href="#ftnt41" id="ftnt_ref41">[41]</a></sup><span class="c4">&nbsp;and increases in the scale and severity of factory farming. In short, the ethical issues become larger and more salient as moral concern becomes broader and more sensitive. Increases in concern for animals and opposition to factory farming would plausibly create an environment favorable to new restrictions, outright bans on factory farming practices, or widespread abstention from animal meat.</span></p><h3 class="c23" id="h.kka7vqgro153"><span class="c18">Major climate events</span></h3><p class="c0"><span>Climate change threatens food production in several ways, including extreme weather events, declines in usable agricultural land, desertification, and changes in precipitation patterns.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt42" id="ftnt_ref42">[42]</a></sup><span class="c4">&nbsp;These changes can affect animal product prices directly (e.g. a hog farm is destroyed by floods) or indirectly (e.g. animal feed prices rise because of declines in arable land). They represent another supply-constraint scenario with additional dimensions. If extreme weather events, for example, are well publicized, affect agricultural production directly, and are seen to be linked to animal agriculture, they could plausibly engender moves&mdash;by necessity or choice&mdash;away from animal meat.</span></p><h2 class="c27 c25" id="h.ql59mvz9d956"><span class="c15 c17">Involvement of current players</span></h2><p class="c0"><span>Tyson Foods&rsquo; recent investment in Beyond Meat and Cargill&rsquo;s recent investment in Memphis Meats indicate lower likelihood of meat industry opposition to clean meat. If established food producers see clean meat as economical and scalable&mdash;if they can cut costs and expand production by using it&mdash;they&rsquo;re more likely to adopt it than they would be a technology that can&rsquo;t be coopted, put into their own supply chains, and scaled up. (See, for example, oil and coal companies&rsquo; failure to meaningfully invest in e.g. solar and wind power, which leaves many committed as a matter of financial survival to blocking or delaying the uptake of these technologies.)</span><sup><a href="#ftnt43" id="ftnt_ref43">[43]</a></sup></p><h2 class="c27 c25" id="h.5b6bdrtn9y43"><span class="c15 c17">Public narrative</span></h2><p class="c0"><span>Popular perceptions of emerging technologies are both important and fickle. </span><span>Key here is Baumgartner and Jones&rsquo; point that public discourse tends to focus on one facet of an issue at a time, often swinging from euphoria to dread.</span><sup class="c13"><a href="#ftnt44" id="ftnt_ref44">[44]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">There may be reasons to be cautious of advancing even scientifically-sound explanations for why clean meat is safe, especially if these explanations are overly technical. As Hans Mathias Kepplinger notes,</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0 c19"><span>the reduction of the negative side effects of technology&mdash;or the risks of technology&mdash;does not necessarily lead to a decrease in fears and concern. Instead, even small dangers become the occasion for great concern due to increased interest in remote events and potential incidents. It can therefore hardly be supposed that an increase in safety of nuclear power plants or genetic engineering automatically increases acceptance. Making increased safety a theme of topical interest would presumably rather add to the concern than reduce it, because it brings facts found to be threatening into people&rsquo;s consciousness without the population being able to understand the arguments.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt45" id="ftnt_ref45">[45]</a></sup></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Kepplinger cites as an example water fluoridation experiments</span><span>&nbsp;in which researchers found that &ldquo;acceptance [of fluoridation] dropped due solely to the subject being made a theme of popular interest. This was still the case even if the arguments in favour of fluoridation were presented in a suitable way</span><span>.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt46" id="ftnt_ref46">[46]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;Ralph Nader and engineer-turned-activist John Abbotts relate a story in which the US Atomic Energy Commission released &ldquo;Theoretical Possibilities and Consequences of Major Accidents in Large Nuclear Plants,&rdquo; a 1957 report intended, at least in part, to show in detail how unlikely such accidents were. The effort backfired when activists and the public focused on projected casualty numbers included in the report (e.g. 3,400 deaths and upwards of 40,000 injuries in one scenario).</span><sup><a href="#ftnt47" id="ftnt_ref47">[47]</a></sup></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Additionally, public debates tend not to focus on a specific chain of well-established technical claims (which is often necessary for arguing why a given technology is safe) but instead glide from concern to concern: &ldquo;As the opposition [to nuclear power] developed, its basis broadened out to reveal successive layers or facets of concern. This made it difficult to identify a set of cogent issues and provided scope for the debate to shift from one concern to another.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt48" id="ftnt_ref48">[48]</a></sup><span class="c4">&nbsp;This type of shifting concern-cloud is difficult to dissipate with focused arguments, no matter how well-grounded.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Kepplinger further notes that the increasingly critical role played by journalists since the middle of the 20th century tends to complicate public perceptions of new technology. Kepplinger documents how much more critical (or less credulous) journalists have become in the last century, writing that &ldquo;from the beginning of the century until the mid-1960s, about 7% of all contributions in the Swedish press contained references to criticism of persons, organizations or conditions,&rdquo; but that by the end of the 1960s &ldquo;the share of contributions containing criticism rose&hellip; to nearly 30%.&rdquo; In Germany, meanwhile, &ldquo;the share of contributions containing criticism of technology rose between 1965 and 1986 from 15-20% to 30-50%.&rdquo; He argues that these changes had four main consequences:</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0 c19"><span>First, criticism of persons, institutions and circumstances received more publicity. Secondly, the intensified publicity increased the readiness for public criticism. Thirdly, it became more likely that negative events, among them the unintentional results of science and technology, received news coverage. Fourthly, the subjective points of view of journalists increasingly shaped the contents of news coverage. This takes place, among other things, through &lsquo;instrumental actualization&rsquo;, that is, the preferred news coverage of events and opinions which confirm journalists&rsquo; own views.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt49" id="ftnt_ref49">[49]</a></sup></p><p class="c0 c19 c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>The views of journalists matter. Kepplinger reports that coverage by prominent newspapers was a </span><span class="c3">leading</span><span>, not lagging, indicator for public sentiment during nuclear debates in Germany in the 1970s and &rsquo;80s: &ldquo;The time-lag correlations show that&mdash;taking the entire period from 1975 to 1986&mdash;the coverage by Stern (0.66), Der Spiegel (0.71) and Frankfurter Rundschau (0.47) anticipated the views of the population by three, two or one years respectively.&rdquo; (Numbers in parentheses are the time-lag correlations.) He concludes: &ldquo;we may rule out the idea that the coverage simply reflected the views of the majority of the population on nuclear energy&hellip;. the coverage of the mass media did not primarily reflect but shaped the opinions of the majority.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt50" id="ftnt_ref50">[50]</a></sup></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>As will be discussed in the next section, nuclear power in the US stalled in large part because activist pushback translated into political action. The main grist for activist pushback came about when preexisting fears (nuclear power is dangerous) met real safety incidents (Three Mile Island, Chernobyl). This implies that, in addition to doing everything possible to reduce the possibility of safety incidents with clean meat, it is sound strategy to avoid dwelling on safety risks with clean meat, even in an effort to rebut them, and to focus instead on positive aspects of clean meat rather than preexisting fears and to be especially wary of risking incidents that would confirm preexisting concerns. The Three Mile Island meltdown in the US killed no one but appeared to vindicate the public fear and uncertainty surrounding nuclear power.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt51" id="ftnt_ref51">[51]</a></sup></p><h2 class="c27 c25" id="h.2afyupakgkzj"><span>What can the US case teach us?</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Like France, the US undergoes a similar nuclear-electricity bump in the 1970s (also revolving around the oil shock of 1973). Unlike France, US nuclear never accounts for more than 21% of electricity generation. Why?</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">As mentioned previously, the US case differs from the French case in two important ways: different conditions for adoption (resource availability and institutional culture) and for anti-nuclear resistance (US anti-nuclear activism was able to translate itself into effective political opposition because of differences between French/US governance and the meltdown at Three Mile Island). Both of these conditions have appeared in this report (see previous discussion of resource availability and centralization and technocracy), but I&rsquo;d like to add a few numbers that reinforce the strength of US energy and meat production.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>The US enjoyed cheaper and more reliable access to domestic reserves of coal and oil than did France. Though US domestic oil production had peaked in 1970 at 9.6 million barrels of oil per day, it was still quite high&mdash;9.2 million barrels per day&mdash;when the oil price shock hit in 1973. France, by contrast, had almost no domestically-produced oil.</span><sup class="c13"><a href="#ftnt52" id="ftnt_ref52">[52]</a></sup></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>US meat production resembles US oil production. For example, in 2015, Americans consumed 11.25 billion kilograms (24.8 billion pounds) of beef against production of 10.75 billion kg (23.7 billion pounds).</span><sup><a href="#ftnt53" id="ftnt_ref53">[53]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;The US is the world&rsquo;s largest poultry producer and the second-largest exporter of pork. Therefore, for the US, fears of food dependence are unlikely to play nearly the role fears of energy dependence played in precipitating the French switch to nuclear. However, states and regions that import most of their food may be more susceptible to institutional adoption of clean meat (see </span><span class="c3">The case for Singapore</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;below).</span></p><h3 class="c23" id="h.gf3e7jwqd4yd"><span class="c18">Early adopters often pay a price</span></h3><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Jasper, writing on the adoption of nuclear power, suggests that</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0 c19"><span>there are penalties for taking the lead in many technological innovations and merits to borrowing from other countries. The United States lacked the regulatory structure to reshape nuclear energy and recover from the shocks of leaping on the nuclear bandwagon before the technology was fully developed. Likewise France benefited from borrowing light water technology almost intact from the United States. By the time of the Messmer Plan, light water technology was developed enough so that standardization was a reasonable option. Whether a country adopts a technology early or late influences its costs, even though the ultimate effect of costs on policies depends in turn on organizational arrangements.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt54" id="ftnt_ref54">[54]</a></sup></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">It is plausible that clean meat technology could enter a scenario in which high-income countries who are able to produce it in the nearer future, like the US, pay higher initial costs (we can already see the outlines of this in the consumer market, where animal-free products of different kinds often enter the market from the top, as a high-end good) and later entrants benefit from cheaper, more efficient, second-generation technology.</span></p><h3 class="c23" id="h.rsotrlelkx99"><span class="c18">The case for Singapore (and places like it)</span></h3><p class="c0"><span>The French adoption of nuclear power indicates that a country&rsquo;s domestic supply of a good can affect its adoption of a replacement good. Most clean meat projects are based in the US and focus on the US market. As mentioned above, the US has achieved a high degree of &ldquo;meat independence.&rdquo; The US imported just 14% of beef consumed in 2014.</span><sup class="c13"><a href="#ftnt55" id="ftnt_ref55">[55]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;Poultry imports are even lower, accounting for ~0.3% of consumption from 2006 to 2012.</span><sup class="c13"><a href="#ftnt56" id="ftnt_ref56">[56]</a></sup></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">What about countries in which the reverse is true? It is likely that states and regions that import large percentages of their food and see science and engineering as national strengths may be receptive to the institutional adoption of clean meat earlier than other markets.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Singapore, for example, imports around 90% of its food and invests heavily in its science and engineering capability.</span><sup class="c13"><a href="#ftnt57" id="ftnt_ref57">[57]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;The Singaporean government has shown itself willing to initiate top-down projects that rely on emerging technology. For example, Singapore&rsquo;s Changi General Hospital hosts a variety of trials for emerging medical technology, including autonomous delivery robots and bandage systems that detect blood.</span><sup class="c13"><a href="#ftnt58" id="ftnt_ref58">[58]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;Singapore&rsquo;s flagship university, National University of Singapore (NUS), operates a robust Food Science &amp; Technology Programme that conducts work on, e.g., the &ldquo;development of functional bakery products with tea antioxidants,&rdquo; &ldquo;high intensity ultrasound aided yogurt fermentation,&rdquo; and, of course, &ldquo;modeling and control system design of frozen dough process.&rdquo;</span><sup class="c13"><a href="#ftnt59" id="ftnt_ref59">[59]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;It is, in short, a place unafraid of food technology. The Agri-Food &amp; Veterinary Authority of Singapore reports that local food production is a policy priority and aims to supply 30% of the island&rsquo;s egg consumption domestically.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt60" id="ftnt_ref60">[60]</a></sup><span class="c4">&nbsp;The Singaporean government is notoriously centralized, authoritarian, and technocratic, all elements which have contributed to faster-than-usual adoption of emerging technologies that are perceived as meeting a national interest like food security.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Other regions, city-states, or nation-states with some elements of this dynamic include Slovenia, Hong Kong, the UAE, Israel, China, both Koreas, Japan, Ireland, the Netherlands,</span><sup><a href="#ftnt61" id="ftnt_ref61">[61]</a></sup><span class="c4">&nbsp;Algeria, Qatar, Lebanon, and Taiwan. The dynamic of differing susceptibility to clean meat across states is probably understudied.</span></p><h1 class="c32 c25" id="h.s7xkxy2xr1iu"><span class="c15 c26">Reasons you might want to doubt this analysis or clean meat adoption in general</span></h1><h2 class="c27 c25" id="h.emvdufvdpnff"><span class="c15 c17">Clean meat might not function as a straightforward substitute good for animal meat</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c4">This study has largely proceeded on the assumption that clean meat, once scalable, will function as a substitute good for animal meat. That is, as clean meat consumption rises, it will displace animal meat. I think this is a reasonable assumption absent strong evidence either way, given the obvious similarities between the two product categories. There are a few complicating points to consider, however: even similar goods are usually less-than-perfect substitutes for each other, clean meat could in fact become a complementary good to animal meat, or no clear relationship of substitution or complementarity could be established between the two.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Ferenc Toth and Hans-Holger Rogner offer an example of this complexity in their analysis of the relationship between nuclear and oil in energy markets in the 20th century. They find, for example, that &ldquo;[s]ince 1973 nuclear power expanded its market share in electricity generation essentially at the cost of oil. In absolute terms, however, oil sales to power generation did not decline&mdash;[they] rather increased slightly.&rdquo;</span><sup class="c13"><a href="#ftnt62" id="ftnt_ref62">[62]</a></sup><span class="c4">&nbsp;This fact implies that if the market for meat continues to grow globally (as the market for power did), clean meat could be introduced and take significant market share from animal meat, but that total animal meat consumed could continue to rise. This outcome has probably been understudied relative to its likelihood.</span></p><h2 class="c27 c25" id="h.ni4em59zp09i"><span class="c15 c17">Social processes like the adoption of new technology are highly unpredictable</span></h2><p class="c0"><span>The adoption of a new technology occurs within multiple overlapping complex systems, each of which contains many interacting variables and is difficult or impossible to model well. Even nonmathematical or narrative attempts at understanding evince frustration with the arbitrary nature of the social circumstances braided into technological change. Dorothy Nelkin notes with an air of mystification: &ldquo;Exploring the public resistance to technology in America, one is immediately struck with a paradox. Some technologies provoke organized opposition; others, no less invasive, no more benign, are welcomed, or, at the least, they are accepted with comparatively little debate.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt63" id="ftnt_ref63">[63]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;James Jasper adds that not only do worldviews and institutional culture complicate economic or functional explanations of the adoption of new technologies, but also entire industries can hang on the biographies and predilections of individual bureaucrats.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt64" id="ftnt_ref64">[64]</a></sup><span class="c4">&nbsp;One wants very much to avoid being overly deductive or giving a false sense of precision in this area. Humility and intelligently navigating large possibility spaces remain essential.</span></p><h2 class="c27 c25" id="h.ywn8civ3xiap"><span class="c15 c17">Future food production techniques are also highly unpredictable</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c4">The radical unpredictability of future technologies appeared in the brief discussion of the projected decline of French nuclear power in the 2020s. Beyond a ten or fifteen year time horizon, there is little evidence of successful prediction of food technology. It is possible that clean meat could be part of an evolution in food production that leads to worse outcomes for animals in the medium and far future. However, it seems likely that given present knowledge and evidence available to us, working to introduce clean meat is likely to reduce animal suffering a large amount for the foreseeable future.</span></p><h2 class="c27 c25" id="h.lfemx599s9qb"><span class="c15 c17">Nuclear could be highly disanalogous to clean meat</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Nuclear energy and meat production are two different technology stacks in different markets. Consumer choice is more important in food than in energy markets. It is rare, although not unheard of, to go to your utility company and select what kind of power you want to consume the way you might select dinner. Although this study has been primarily interested in how institutional uptake works, popular views and consumer choice matter.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Martin Bauer, when comparing opposition movements against nuclear, biological, and and information technology, notes that the scale and type of risk differs across domains and can affect the likelihood and strength of resistance. &ldquo;Comparisons,&rdquo; Bauer writes, &ldquo;are furthermore complicated by the fact that public risk perception is not cumulative; it does not add up many small risks to give one large risk. Risk perception feeds on the size and controllability of danger, and less on its probability&hellip;. This difference may explain the presence or absence of large-scale organized resistance.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt65" id="ftnt_ref65">[65]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;When it comes to scaling the technology, clean meat is likely to face fewer obstacles than nuclear power. The potential scope of disaster is smaller and less cinematic. However, when it comes to </span><span class="c3">type</span><span>&nbsp;of risk, uncertainty persists around consumed products like clean meat. &nbsp;&ldquo;Type of risk,&rdquo; Bauer suggests, &ldquo;makes a difference for public perception. The health risks of [nuclear, bio, and info] technologies vary. Radiation touches the problem of physical well-being of individuals and society. Leukaemia, cancer and malformations at birth are issues central to people&rsquo;s life concerns. By contrast the problems of information technology are more abstract,&rdquo; and biotech remains uncertain in its own way: &ldquo;In new areas of biotechnology and genetic engineering health risks are an open question, and more of a diffuse but widespread concern than well defined.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt66" id="ftnt_ref66">[66]</a></sup></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>The risk landscape of clean meat seems to resemble other biotech in certain ways. Biotech research, unlike nuclear power, has not seen the kind of focused opposition that could be translated into real political curtailment.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt67" id="ftnt_ref67">[67]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;Gene therapy and new drug development continue apace. Joachim Radkau notes that opponents of biotech &ldquo;suspected that with the advent of AIDS the biotechnical equivalent of Chernobyl had already happened. However... the practical significance of several hypothetical risks of genetic engineering has not become clear. Perhaps it is the wrong way to look for a risk of the Chernobyl type&mdash;the search for an over-exact analogy may be misleading!&mdash;and perhaps it may be erroneous, too, to look for the kind of risk which is specific to genetic engineering alone.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt68" id="ftnt_ref68">[68]</a></sup><span class="c4">&nbsp;Indeed, searching different case histories for highly specific risk analogies is probably not an effective research strategy. It is likely more useful to understand, even in some limited way, broader dynamics of resistance and adoption.</span></p><h1 class="c25 c32" id="h.x3oo69q6271u"><span>Bibliography</span></h1><p class="c0 c14"><span>Bauer, Martin (editor). </span><span class="c3">Resistance to New Technology</span><span class="c4">.
