<h2>Team Openings</h2>
<p>We are currently accepting applications for a researcher on a rolling basis. Please see the information below. We encourage you to apply sooner rather than later.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We also welcome brief expressions of interest for other roles that can strengthen our research and positive impact, which you can send to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:info@sentienceinstitute.org">info@sentienceinstitute.org</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Researcher</h1>
<p>This position offers a lot of flexibility with few requirements other than the production of high-quality research that fits within&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/mission">our mission</a>. We are open to a variety of research methods: qualitative (e.g. historical case studies, interviews, conceptual analysis), quantitative (e.g. surveys, behavioral experiments, analysis of existing industry and survey data), or mixed methods. As of 2023, most of&nbsp;<a href="http://sentienceinstitute.org/blog">our research</a> has been behavioral experiments and surveys, so we are especially interested in projects in human-computer/robot/AI interaction and &lsquo;macro&rsquo; social science (e.g., sociology, economics).</p>
<h3>Research Topics</h3>
<p>Our main research focus is <bold>digital minds</bold>: robots and artificial intelligences (AI) that are not merely intelligent in the sense of problem-solving ability, but have mental capacities such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1134475">experience and agency</a>. Because this is such a new field, a lot of our research so far has been big-picture in nature. For example, we have a&nbsp;<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11948-021-00331-8">literature review</a> on the moral consideration of artificial entities, psychology experiments on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/downloads/predicting-the-moral-consideration-of-artificial-intelligences.pdf">predictors</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://osf.io/4r3g9">features</a> of moral consideration for artificial entities, a&nbsp;<a href="https://osf.io/udbhm">US nationally representative survey</a> on people&rsquo;s moral attitudes towards digital minds, and papers on the&nbsp;<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s43681-023-00260-1">moral standing of AI</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0020174X.2022.2144442">digital suffering</a>. Over the next few years, we expect to continue to produce research aimed at building a robust body of theoretical and empirical literature in this field. Our publications to date include:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>
      &ldquo;<a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s11948-021-00331-8">The Moral Consideration of Artificial Entities: A Literature Review.&rdquo;</a> 2021.&nbsp;<em>Science and Engineering Ethics.</em>
  </li>
  <li>
      <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.futures.2021.102756">&ldquo;Moral Circle Expansion: A Promising Strategy to Impact the Far Future.&rdquo;</a> 2021.&nbsp;<em>Futures</em>.
  </li>
  <li>
      <a href="https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/aims-survey-2021">&ldquo;Artificial Intelligence, Morality, and Sentience (AIMS) Survey 2021.&rdquo;</a> 2022. Sentience Institute.
  </li>
  <li>
      <a href="https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/the-history-of-ai-rights-research">&ldquo;The History of AI Rights Research.&rdquo;</a> 2022. Sentience Institute.
  </li>
  <li>
      <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2022.107372">&ldquo;Predicting the Moral Consideration of Artificial Intelligences.&rdquo;</a> 2022.&nbsp;<em>Computers in Human Behavior.</em>
  </li>
  <li>
      <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0020174X.2022.2144442">&ldquo;Digital suffering: Why it&rsquo;s a Problem and How to Prevent it.&rdquo;</a> 2022.&nbsp;<em>Inquiry.</em>
  </li>
  <li>
      <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s43681-023-00260-1">&ldquo;What would qualify an artificial intelligence for moral standing?&rdquo;</a> 2023.&nbsp;<em>AI and Ethics.</em>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>We are particularly interested in work on human-computer/robot/AI interaction and &lsquo;macro&rsquo; social science (e.g., sociology, economics) where we see important projects beyond the capacity of our current staff. Overarching questions for the field of digital minds include:
<ul>
  <li>
      What digital minds will exist in short- and long-term futures?
  </li>
  <li>
      How will humans react to digital minds?
  </li>
  <li>
      What is the philosophical nature and moral worth of digital minds?
  </li>
  <li>
      How will digital minds interact, and what kind of society will that create?
  </li>
  <li>
      What strategies are most promising for improving futures with digital minds?
  </li>
</ul>
<p>When SI was founded in 2017, we were primarily focused on&nbsp;farmed animals&nbsp;as the frontier of humanity&apos;s moral circle. We continue to do some work on this area but don&rsquo;t expect it to be a key focus for this role. We expect our future research on this to be similar to our previous research, most of which is listed on<a href="https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/research">&nbsp;our Reports page</a>.</p>
<h4>Publications</h4>
<p>We want all of our research to be thoroughly vetted and publically available, and we are open to various publication formats. Our previous publications have been reports (i.e. white papers, working papers), academic journal articles, blog posts, newspaper and magazine articles, conference presentations, and a book. The best publication format depends partly on the content and audience of the work, but we also consider how we can support early-career researchers, and some publication formats may be more useful for their professional development.</p>
<h3>Specific Tasks and Duties</h3>
<p>This is, in general, what our researchers work on:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
      Collaborate with our small team to decide what projects to pursue.
  </li>
  <li>
      Conduct that research fairly independently, typically with regular check-ins and peer review prior to publication. Frequent questions and meetings will be expected at the beginning, but should slow down over time as you become more familiar with the research literature and methods.
  </li>
  <li>
      Pursue skill development. For example, a qualitatively oriented researcher could take a statistics course online in order to develop some quantitative expertise.
  </li>
  <li>
      Provide assistance as needed with other research projects and ideas, mainly by reviewing research for accuracy, clarity, quality of the reasoning, and overlooked evidence.
  </li>
  <li>
      Since we&rsquo;re a small organization, depending on your individual preferences and abilities, you may also have opportunities to take on other organizational tasks. Examples include administrative and management work, interviews and media commentary, and meeting with and advising organizations who are interested in our research findings.
  </li>
</ul>
