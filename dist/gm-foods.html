class="c0">The minute they tell you not to worry about something, you worry.</span></p><p class="c10"><span>&nbsp;&mdash; North London woman on GMOs, 1996</span><sup><a href="#ftnt1" id="ftnt_ref1">[1]</a></sup></p><hr><p class="c8 c23"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c10"><span>The use of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in food</span><sup><a href="#ftnt2" id="ftnt_ref2">[2]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;has been riddled with controversy for five decades, including various cases of adoption and rejection that coincide with a range of messaging and activism. Studying this history can yield useful conclusions for predicting the adoption of other potentially controversial food technologies. Of course, the comparisons need to be accompanied by discussion of the relevant analogies and disanalogies.</span></p><p class="c10"><span>I begin with an outline of genetic engineering technology and the route </span><span>GM foods</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;have taken to acceptance or rejection in US and EU markets, since these have been the main battlegrounds of GM adoption. The bulk of the report will discuss various analogies and disanalogies between GM food adoption and the case of clean meat, a nascent food technology that could face similar controversies. Finally, I will summarize the implications and major findings of the report.</span></p><p class="c10"><span>This case study doesn&#39;t argue for or against GM food. We&rsquo;re interested in how GM foods became an object of controversy and how this has affected their adoption. We&rsquo;re looking for strategic lessons for people who are working on the adoption of new, potentially controversial technologies like </span><span>clean and plant-based</span><span>&nbsp;meat&mdash;as well as, to a lesser extent, lessons for people working to oppose similar technologies.</span></p><p class="c10"><span>Overall, this report provides evidence for </span><span>the following claims</span><span>:</span></p><ul class="c30 lst-kix_dhtesfw4qy7u-0 start"><li class="c6"><span class="c0">Developers of emerging technologies should avoid being unduly secretive, aggressive, or arrogant&mdash;or even being perceived this way by activists or the general public.</span></li><li class="c6"><span>Even if the developers of a technology are transparent and socially conscious when the technology first emerges (as clean meat advocates are today), there is still significant risk of negative perception down the road. The first GMO firms to market like </span><span class="c22"><a class="c14" href="#h.4g331r69z0d9">Calgene and Zeneca</a></span><span class="c0">&nbsp;were also relatively transparent and socially conscious, yet those firms merged with or were acquired by larger firms. Moreover, even the developers at those larger firms saw themselves as innovators and humanitarians, suggesting that much caution is needed with emerging technology even if one has the best intentions.</span></li><li class="c6"><span class="c0">Activists should focus more on relatively small campaigns, especially those that pressure companies occupying vulnerable positions in a supply chain, rather than large campaigns that rely on shifting public opinion. Much of the successful activist action against GM food came in this form.</span></li><li class="c6"><span class="c0">When buyers can exert more pressure on sellers than the reverse, technology adoption is more readily affected by advocacy because buyers and firms further down the supply chain are more susceptible to consumer pressure.</span></li><li class="c6"><span class="c0">It is often difficult to convince emerging technology firms to use effective strategies, even though the effective strategies can be relatively easy to figure out and implementing them is in the long-term best interests of the nascent industry.</span></li><li class="c6"><span class="c0">No single feature of a technology is sufficient to ensure or prohibit adoption (e.g. being perceived as unnatural). Technology advocates shouldn&rsquo;t put all their resources into a single issue, even if it&rsquo;s the most important issue.</span></li><li class="c6"><span>Focusing on the positive aspects of a technology has been more successful for encouraging its adoption than focusing on responding to negative perceptions.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt3" id="ftnt_ref3">[3]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;Constant discussion of safety concerns, even if to answer these concerns in a technically-sound manner, tends to displace positive framing of an issue and reinforce the idea that there is something to fear. This dynamic is exacerbated by the fact that non-experts often make decisions based on acceptability rather than risk, so a technical totting-up of the relative risks and benefits of a technology is likely to be subsumed in public discussion to a reactive acceptability/nonacceptability binary.</span></li></ul><p class="c10"><span>Further implications and findings are described </span><span class="c22"><a class="c14" href="#h.vfmgrorj1gdt">below</a></span><span class="c0">.</span></p><h1 class="c25" id="h.dvejmio4jzt7"><span class="c17">How did GM food come to be?</span></h1><p class="c10"><span>Modern genetic engineering began in 1972 when biochemist Paul Berg opened a loop of simian virus DNA, inserted genes from Enterobacteria phage &lambda;, and reclosed the monkey virus&rsquo;s dimer circle with part of the lambda phage&rsquo;s DNA inside.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt4" id="ftnt_ref4">[4]</a></sup></p><p class="c13"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 626.20px; height: 719.98px;"><img alt="" src="images/gmos/image6.png" style="width: 626.20px; height: 719.98px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><h5 class="c34" id="h.v976o373h6pc"><span class="c36">Fig. 1. Berg&rsquo;s original method for combining the DNA of two different viruses. Berg, &ldquo;Biochemical Method,&rdquo; 2905.</span></h5><p class="c10"><span>In 1973, Herbert Boyer and Stanley Cohen spliced a variety of genes into E. coli, including genes that endowed the altered bacteria with certain types of antibiotic resistance and genes from the toad Xenopus laevis (a common model organism).</span><sup><a href="#ftnt5" id="ftnt_ref5">[5]</a></sup></p><p class="c10"><span>Safety concerns accompanied recombinant DNA research from the beginning. Paul Berg had originally intended to re-insert his hybrid simian virus/lambda virus DNA into E. coli, but did not carry out this step due to fears that the altered form of E. coli might spread to humans.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt6" id="ftnt_ref6">[6]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;In 1975, Berg organized the Asilomar Conference on Recombinant DNA, a meeting of about 140 scientists, lawyers, and doctors that put forward voluntary but influential guidelines on rDNA research. These guidelines included steps like building containment procedures directly into experimental design.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt7" id="ftnt_ref7">[7]</a></sup></p><p class="c10"><span>By 1976, Boyer started Genentech, widely recognized as the first genetic engineering (GE) company, with venture capital funding. By 1977, the firm had inserted genes for insulin production into E. coli.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt8" id="ftnt_ref8">[8]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;Five years later, the FDA approved Humulin, a form of synthetic insulin pioneered by Genentech. Today, GM strains of yeast or E. coli produce most of the world&rsquo;s insulin, making insulin more widely available for diabetics.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt9" id="ftnt_ref9">[9]</a></sup></p><p class="c10"><span>Research into transgenic food began in the 1970s and by 1982 had produced the first transgenic plant, a tobacco plant resistant to the antibiotic kanamycin.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt10" id="ftnt_ref10">[10]</a></sup></p><p class="c10"><span>GM crops were not commercialized until 1992, when Chinese farmers planted strains of virus-resistant tobacco.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt11" id="ftnt_ref11">[11]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;GM tobacco was pulled from China between 1995 and 1997 after tobacco buyers, especially US cigarette manufacturers, worried that consumers would reject GM tobacco.</span></p><p class="c10"><span>The first commercially-available GM food, Calgene&rsquo;s Flavr Savr tomato, incorporated a gene that slowed pectin degradation and therefore extended the tomato&rsquo;s shelf life. Calgene introduced the tomato in May of 1994. Despite pushback from early anti-GMO activists like Jeremy Rifkin, the Flavr Savr remained in demand.
